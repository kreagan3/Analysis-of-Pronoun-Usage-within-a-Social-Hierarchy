S1: so is this Kelvin? is that right? [S2: um, John, ] oh John Munt.


S2: yeah, (xx) [S1: oh wow ] so i have to (xx) yeah, (xx)


S1: okay mkay


S1: yeah, (xx) so, you?


SU-f: can i have, that back for a second?


S1: sure


S2: okay, yes, [S1: alright ] i was working on this forever and i was getting all confused so i just had to stop, cuz


S1: okay, Wien's Law which is uh what is it like one over lambda-max equals, or actually it's like zero-point-two-nine isn't that what it is? something. do you have your book?


S2: yes.


S1: okay.


S2: see i understand the concept, but i don't understand (xx)


S1: okay. <PAUSE WHILE READING> here's your book, do you want, it? [SU-m: oh yeah ] (xx) i'll leave it here


SU-m: see the real reason (xx) they're recording us, sometimes you get a little abusive of the tutors [S2: oh wow ] (just) smack 'em around if they don't know the answers


S2: maybe i should step outside, cuz i don't you know (xx)


SU-m: so you know


S1: it's actually_ they're actually uh very uh, blatantly bugging the office, so <LAUGH> um, okay so, so Wien's Law <PAUSE:04> so, the second radiation law's related (xx) so hot stars look blue and cool stars look red, Wien's Law tells us that things like wavelength (xx) s- star (it says that, three thousand over T of N) so what is the wavelength based on radiation? um, for example (Log, Hayes) how do stars create, these two laws (xx) okay so now um, so what does it ask? what


S2: okay the continuous structure [S1: mhm ] emission (xx) and i was thinking, first i was thinking that (continuous) yes [S1: mhm ] because, (xx) quasar extended, [S1: mhm ] it's easier to do than (xx) <LAUGH> um, and i was also thinking, that, there's a line in the book, that says, (xx) recognize (xx) stars. [S1: right ] but then, it would also apply to, this is where i get confused.


S1: the emission?


S2: yeah because it seems like it would be all of 'em if it's, continuous (emission spectra) (xx)


S1: i don't think that ma- might make sense. okay what causes an emission spectra?


S2: it's, the, the spectrum's going through a, fairly dense heat.


S1: okay. so it's going, like, the um... lambda-max that's, the, that's the wavelength of the maximum, on it, that's our radius (xx) T, as far as temperature. so, well let's think though, okay so, what causes absorption again?


S2: we're in a continuous spectrum, and it's going through, some kinda gas i can't remember


S1: okay like, hot dense gas [S2: yeah ] or something? alright so we actually know these. where are they back here somewhere? radio (xx) <> mm, there's something there, light and pulse strokes? <> it think it's the, okay blah blah blah


S2: so, okay


S1: the (original) is emitted by the gas, okay? so, is the absorption, is, emitted, by


<PAUSE:05>
S2: it's still emitted by the source, it's going through


S1: so you're still seeing the, source but the, whatever the um, gas is is taking out a couple lines.


S2: okay and that's, the, that's how you can tell which, element it is?


S1: yeah yes.


S2: because, certain elements will absorb certain, photons [S1: right ] or whatever lines (xx) [S1: mhm ] it's the same for like emission though


S1: so that's_ but for emission you're actually viewing, the um, i think you're actually (given something that comes out) [S2: (xx) the gas, ] right so um, i'm, let's, make sure, understand page fifty, let me show you, one-thirty-one, (xx) <PAUSE:05> here's absorption, okay um, these bond (with that) (especially with neon sign,) (xx) [S2: this is where i get confused. ] so the pinkish-purple, color, (wait, doesn't it question) something about the, mercury vapor (xx)


S2: yeah that's where i got it from, (xx) they're both emission, lines. (xx) piece, um, for spectrum. um, i was saying, i wanted to say yes, [S1: mhm ] because, that would be hotter than, [S1: (right) ] um, i don't know and, this law with that law (xx)


S1: mhm, um by (studying) the spectral lines we can identify the elements uh-huh-huh-huh-huh, i wanna say that it is all, three of them.


S2: okay do these (xx) right here, these two, um, emission spectra, solaria, gas will be excited (xx) so that means it's hot, [S1: mhm ] but if it's hot, it's not gonna be red, is it?


S1: um, it depends how hot it is you know there's like, different degrees of hot (xx)


S2: (you see, i was confused) (xx) (red so then)


S1: okay so you said_ okay so, the neon tube is red so it's cooler than, the mercury tube,


S2: but there'd still be an emission, line so (xx)


S1: yeah (it's) just different, degrees of the emission. and so i mean if you're_ okay so if this is emission, and you're saying that even if you can say, that this bright red is cooler than that, and you're using Wien's Law.


S2: you can, tell the relative temperature.


S1: yeah yeah


S2: which is (xx) okay. (i wanna deal with that first.)


S1: mkay... why don't_ lemme just, lemme just consult, Charlie? wanna um okay if you've got, threes types of absorption you got continuous or, three types of emissions, [S3: mm ] spectrum, <S1: LAUGH>[S3: yeah ] continuous absorption and emission [S3: uhuh ] and you've got Wien's Law, Wien's Law [S3: uhuh ] does that apply to all of them, or only a, couple of 'em?


S3: um, Wien's Law only applies to continuous [S1: (does it?) ] spectra alright? [S2: okay ] um, well, that's not no no i'm sorry, [S1: (xx) <LAUGH>] i'm wrong. Wien's Law only applies to black bodies, alright? [S2: okay <LAUGH>] lemme, lemme lemme give you this alright? let me say it like this, a black body, ba- [S1: i had to get up ] yes that's cool. a black body is is is in a sense a perfect emitter okay? any energy that comes in it absorbs, and any abs- energy absorbs within the mass, so basically, um, the_ i mean it's it's the perfect emitter okay? you can't, you can't get uh, more, you can't get, more protons from anything than a black body at a given, at a given uh, at a given (time) the the, um, so, wha- what happens is, Wien's Law applies to a black body and it describes a black body. now, the thing about, the only bad thing about a black body is there's no such thing physically, you know. however, there are a lot of things that are very very close. um, they yeah it does give off a continuous spectra, however things like um, there's other types of thi- there's uh things you haven't dealt with like (xx) [S1: by (xx) ] yeah <S2: LAUGH> but, they give off continuous spectra too but it's just not, uh, i- i- it's uh, a different kind, yeah, so uh, Wien's Law applies to a bla- and where's our Wien's Law in here? it's a, sigma-T over four.


S2: (xx) one twenty-six, okay


S3: one twenty-six? [S2: yeah ] yeah, so this says, the energy, is equal, the energy given off, is equal, yeah, oh, yeah, okay this is the uh, Wien's Law is the, the maximum this is, they're, they're similar in the sense that this, the energy of (xx) is equal to, the temperature to the fourth power. so that means you increase something in temperature by, two, increase it, two, increase it two times two times two times two. so uh, you can see we're just giving off energy, from uh uh with a black body, in- increased temperature increased energy (xx) that's why (xx) Wien's Law, gives you the, the maximum, the wavelength the, if you look at a s- if you look at spectra, basically what a spectra is, is they say at this wavelength i got, a hundred photons, at this wavelength i got two hundred photons, this is what it's saying right here. [S2: oh, okay ] so this is the sh- this is a sh- uh a longer wavelength, so it's saying i have less photons here, than i'm dealing with here. so you know basically, there's a little crou- counter here it's going click, every time a photon (going) click click click click, and right here you're know (you'll) say i'll just say, a hundred thousand photons right here at the, at a blue wavelength which is you know about what is this, four hundred fifty nanometers, and you're getting say, five thousand right here, uh seven hundred nanometers, and that's all a spectrum is. it just gives you, the amount of photons (xx)


S1: i think it's only uh, continuous. [S3: hm ] because uh, Wien's Law, only applies to black body, [SU-m: right ] which is continuous.


S3: right, yeah but, yeah that's that's true but see Wien's Law doesn't apply to all types of continuous spectra. yeah but for (no-)


S1: well, but for her, for her purposes, it'd probably be fine. um, let me just see.


S2: but then i don't understand why it couldn't be applied to absorption and emission,


S3: because, the reason is is because


S1: it's not continu- it's not continual?


S3: well, what happens is, you know what causes an emission law right?


S2: yeah, it's, through gas


S3: yeah so you have a a cloud of gas, what happens is there's a star behind this cloud of gas right? lets off radiation, this radiation and what happens in the gas actually, y- you have a little atom, what causes an atom to emit radiation?


S2: it can't absorb it?


S3: it absorbs it first sure, but after that <PAUSE:04> mkay, [S2: (xx) ] yeah, what happens is um, you know atoms right? you have a, you have a nucleus at the center you have electron [S2: mhm ] what happens as a photon comes in, hits the electrons, the electron just basically, it jum- it gets more, energy, okay? and, just because of nature it gets pulled to the small center it just has all this energy, and a little while later you get a few seconds, at the most, it jumps back down (xx)


S1: maybe you, it doesn't apply to the other ones. cuz you're not getting the entire spectrum. [S3: well if thi- if this (xx) ] there's no way that you could, determine the max wavelength just cuz you don't have it, it's not complete


S3: well y- the thing is is in absorption and emission, is uh, comes in at one wavelength, and that's why. like, like for instance here let me tell you, this is a this is an emission line, this is um absorb- or emission spectrum absorption ste- spectrum. i can't i can't apply this, here because when i, when the, the photon comes out from within the individual atoms, there's no temperature associated with it. there's just it just is, it's pure energy


S2: those could just be used to show what element it is?


S3: right exactly


S2: that's not, for temperature


S3: right i mean this, these, you can give off an emission spectrum at, you know two degrees you know uh, twenty-three degrees Fahrenheit or a million degrees Fahrenheit. you can have the same emission. you know [S2: but it wouldn't be, ] i mean, well you, yeah i mean you can give 'em off in different temperatures, like at you know, five thousand, degrees Fahrenheit or, a million degrees Fahrenheit, you can, give give em off


S2: so, the reason why it kinda attracted this one, is because, it has all of the colors, and, whatever, it tends to be, like if it's a higher intensity t could be (considered) higher, so you can kinda tell?


S3: right but yeah yeah because, the reason is just, when you look at this spectrum, what y- what you're gonna see is thing you're gonna see this curve this is like this is called a black body, it's like you look at the sun this is what it, the spectra looks like, okay? um, but see the emission, emission, uh, emission lines, if you looked at a spectra of just emission lines what you see, is, you'd see something like this <PAUSE WHILE WRITING> straight... and this would be different wavelengths, and that's all you'd see if it was just emission lines, okay. [S2: right ] and, you can't associate a maximum wavelength to it, because, all, all that's all that all an emission line tells you, is, it says hey there's hydrogen, and something's making it, kick out photons. [S2: okay ] all absorption's, spectra tells you is, hey there's hydrogen there blocking, uh, there's a star behind that, cloud of hydrogen, and i can tell because i see these absorption lines. [S2: okay ] do you understand that?


S2: okay... hm, here, okay let me just get this real quick so i can (xx) um, so that means, can't use it to tell the relative temperature, because these are emissions lines, [S3: mhm ] and this just shows what kind, of element it is and the temperature of, whatever. [S3: right ] alright, okay i got that now so i'll leave that_ oh yeah. this, i don't get this, calculating stuff. i'm not good at calculating anything. i don't (don't even have a calculator.) i forgot about that part [S3: mkay ] (so)


S3: mkay well, what do i wanna do first? we'll look at this and we say, calculate lambda-max for the following stars and estimate which color dominates the visual spectrum okay, so, what what do we wanna do here?


S2: compute?


S3: well, wanna calculate the maximum wavelength, at a given temperature, okay and this is, this kind of ties into the last problem now what kinds of spectra do you think these guys give off? in between the (xx) and (xx)


S2: hm, okay. <PAUSE:04> we just talked about this today too. i have no idea


S3: okay, um, let me ask you this


S2: if it, well it depends on the lithium string on it right? if you're looking right at it it's gonna be absorption and if you're looking, not directly at it it's gonna be emission?


S3: not really um, if, if you, lemme lemme put it like this, you have a s- you have the sun, okay? [S2: mhm ] or sort some sort of star. and, you uh, you have_ i mean you know how a star works right? fusion on [S2: mhm ] (the inside) [S2: mhm ] okay, what you have is uh, you start out, with a star and it starts with you know hydrogen (xx) you know hydrogen helium, and all the sudden starts fusion, fusion i- these different elements you know fuses you hi- put <SOUND EFFECT> two hydrogens together you get helium you put <SOUND EFFECT> two heliums together you get carbon <SOUND EFFECT> two carbons you get oxygen and on and on and on. alright. well you get all these different elements, so, what happened is you just see uh, what you're gonna see, is, you're gonna see, some sort of_ you're gonna see a spectrum, that's, going to be, associated [S2: but can, can you see them? (can you associate) (xx) because, um, (xx) more elements you can have? ] yeah um, o- okay well, alright. let me explain this to you, you know okay you know i i i'm trying to think. i've never i've never been asked a question like this so that's why i'm kinda struggling i'm trying to get through here, um, what happened? let me put it like this, inside a star, at the center is like fifteen million times alright? it's really hot, and uh in that center you know, you know atoms how they each have their electron's outer shell? you know what ionization is?


S2: (when) you're using electrons?


S3: exactly. exactly so you have a hydrogen atom, if it gets ionized what is the photon comes in, kicks that electron out so hard, it just goes away, it doesn't come back to the, um, so what happens is, you can you can imagine can do that with hydrogen, well you can do that with helium too, all you gotta do is kick out two electrons, and then you go on and on and on, you know you can keep doing any element you want. all you gotta do is basically, kick you know, kick out all the electrons in the, the shell, and absorb it. so, what happens is inside the sun, there really isn't any elements, okay? what this, what you see in there is just, you know a bunch of particles you know, and this is why it kinda causes it, and these particles are very hot cuz of the fusion (xx) and what happens is is uh


S1: does anybody remember how to derive, Wien's Law?


SU-f: Wien's Law? [S1: yeah ] is from


SU-f: oh, isn't that in the thermo book?


S1: is it in the thermo book? oh, probably is, okay. can i borrow your thermo book Charlie?


S3: yeah


S1: i sent a nice letter to uh, the publisher


S3: oh yeah i did too


SU-f: i need to too because my book <SU-f: LAUGH> (xx)


SU-m: i i actually sent it to the sales (representative)


SU-m: i y- i no i should because, i bought it years ago and the same problem, happened


S1: mhm. you should just take this one and go <SOUND EFFECT> (when you're in there and just see if it would work) [S3: yeah ] you could, i won't do that though.


S3: yeah i got a new one but um, so what happens is, let me put it this way, okay absorption spectra and emission spectra can only happen when you have, atoms around, and whole atoms okay? not, [S2: not p- (xx) ] not (xx) continuous spectra happen, when, your temperatures uh, are, very hot, and you have uh, just, you, instead of having atoms you have like electrons and, protons and neutrons all going around the, in general what you have is electrons going around, and these protons are just, the the sh- the nucleus, are just sitting there cuz i mean, electrons are very light you know it's just like, you know the the nucleus is like, a big rock, these, electrons are little ping-pong balls like, no matter how hard those Ping-Pong balls against this big old rock like the rock, it's not gonna move, that's what it's like, okay but these electrons (xx) kick off, they're bouncing around, all this heat's being created, and what's this, what this is giving off, is the continuous spectrum, okay? and then, what happens is you're gonn seeing in a, a spectrum of the sun.


S2: did we (xx) this is that's, oh you said (xx) is that, that's probably (data)


S3: yeah um, the what what you'll see is, what basically happens in like, (xx) what it is is you get you get some sort of continuum spectra, continuous spectra, and then on top of that you have, like an emission line and maybe an absorption line


S2: then you get a fluorescent, (xx) [S3: a bulb? yeah well you saw ] (you get the) continuous emission


S3: yeah you w- oh oh oh well it's yeah yeah, right, and then you looked, did you look at like a helium lamp did you see the pattern [S2: okay i really did not understand ] yeah wha- what you get is something like this, right? but what you'll get in uh, yeah (in this one) what you'll get is like uh, basically if you look at it like this say this is a continuous spectrum, you'll see like right here this'll be really bright. and this here will be really dark something like this, and that's, that's because of the emission and absorption, [S2: mhm ] and that's usually due to some cloud or something around it, well, so what, am i_ are you following me here?


S2: yeah, it's just it takes me a while to get it [S3: that's okay ] (xx) um i still don't understand (that)


S3: so what what we're looking for here, we're looking for something like s- s- these are all stars, okay? and these stars are red hot and these are these are, this is the surface temperature of the star, this isn't the (xx) so what we have to look at here is you know well, (these are things that are pretty well known...) pretty well missed um,


S2: how do you calculate


S3: hm?


S2: wait, just a sec


S3: well what kind of, spectrum, does a star give off?


S1: one-point-one-four (xx) i think that's... cuz, they say what is the Wein's Law applied to, continuous emission (xx)


S7: (it would) be continuous, wouldn't it?


S1: yeah i don't know if it applies to particles [S7: no ] i don't think it does. but i was trying to find (xx)


S7: yeah they're supposed to i think it comes from the the black body (xx)


S1: yeah cuz it comes from, the just the relation... okay.


SU-f: that makes sense.


S1: yeah, okay, i'm almost positive did you, get beyond that? yeah, because the relation itself, comes from relating um, lambda-max and temperature, of a black body. so this, relationship, is just like if you take, you know if you get a spectrum for a black body, [SU-f: mhm ] and you find, measure lambda-max divided by the temperature then multiply by temperature you're always gonna get this one. so i think it's only, continuous. that make sense?


S2: vaguely, yeah.


S1: i mean it's like, just, i mean, are you confused about?


S2: no, i kinda got it. kind, kinda, kinda's better than none.


S1: where's where's the where's the kinda now? okay.


S3: mkay


S2: so that's just trying to figure out how to calculate the [S3: yeah so ] (xx)


S3: yeah, alright, s- stars give off, what kind of uh, this would be uh?


S2: they give off what kind of emission?


S3: yeah, you've probably found (xx) there? what kind of radiation was i talking about earlier? [S2: black body ] yeah, starts to give off black body [S2: okay ] radiation. and in fact most ob- uh objects do like uh if have one of those uh the coil you see on the old stoves the electric stoves you have the coils? okay? same thing except lower temperature. so you know (xx)


S1: are you just trying to calculate


S2: yeah


S1: see it's just using that equation in the back. what is it three (xx) equation, [S2: yeah ] plug in your temperature


S2: (xx) i didn't bring my calculator i forgot about this part, [S3: what's this? ] okay. one (xx) um, okay


S1: it's go- it's in scientific notation, so you'll have to change it. [S2: (it's in scientific nota-) ] it might be good? [S2: yeah ] okay now


S2: yeah, yeah there's, alright so


S1: you're whoa, alright (xx) oh my gosh they had this awesome laser pointer at um, Costco <LAUGH> it um,


S3: does it have a little arrow?


S1: it has arrows, and ha- like it has a dot with two arrows. it has a galaxy, a circle with a dot in it, it's really cool.


S3: (are you gonna switch) [S1: mhm ] wow, how much is it?


S1: twenty bucks.


S3: really? <LAUGH> ooh


S3: do you have to have a membership to work there? or to go there?


S1: or have a, boyfriend that has, a, dad who has a membership, <LAUGH> yeah


SU-m: that's pretty cool, i didn't think about it, like, twenty bucks really?


S1: yeah


SU-m: does it like (columnate it) or is it like, like when you go to the walls is it like (a big) blur?


S1: i don't know.


SU-m: yeah.


S1: and that's gonna give you that, that's like three hundred nanometers.


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S2: wait no, there's three thousand nanometers?


S1: this is this is A-H yeah three that's yeah, that's three hundred distance


S2: okay


S1: that's good, that's in the visibl- almost in the vi- visible range.


S2: okay.


<PAUSE:05>
S2: oops, i should have, how do you know that, you need to (xx)


<PAUSE:05>
S1: <LAUGH> i just inhaled like, air sorry (xx)


S7: <LAUGH> you just inhaled, air um, hey, m- i just get hit on the head.


S1: <LAUGH> i'm like oh, (xx)


S7: (xx) <LAUGH>


S1: you can't tell, [S7: (xx) ] he'll be like, i don't, he used to be really silly and i was like, (just enjoy it)


S7: you get, after everyone leaves, we can, pretend like we got into a fight.


<PAUSE:05>
S3: okay well, let's think about this, [S2: mhm ] well was that, okay what do we got in here? three times ten-to-the-two, (xx) doesn't look too good.


S2: i just put that and divided it [SU-m: mkay ] cuz that's the temperature right? so this, divided by (that)


S3: it looks about right. so what's the (xx) over there?


S1: (xx) over there


S3: oh the nanometers okay, this isn't nanometers [S1: i know (xx) ] yeah.


S2: (xx) so the uh (xx)


S3: so what's this, this is three times ten-to-the-two, that's about three, that's what, so, how many nanometers, in scientific notation.


S2: not, i can't, see it in my head


S3: okay, well it won't be (written down) let's just, you know so th-


S2: um, six hundred?


S3: uhuh right. and


S2: and this would be, five hundred and seventeen?


S3: yup, and


S2: and a thousand?


S3: yup, mkay, so what we wanna do we wanna look through okay and say what, this is the (P quadrent) this is where the m- most photons will be emitted, emitted by these stars. and uh, that's gonna tell us something pretty important, okay? so we say you know, well let's just look uh, let's look here. alright so


S2: okay, that's what i was looking for (xx)


S3: yeah, so what does it look like? this first one where does it look like it'd fit?


S2: three hundred millime- millimeters from there [S3: okay ] that would be right in here


S3: right and yeah i mean


S2: ultraviolet?


S3: yep, right, exactly


S2: hm, i knew it said zero


S3: so yeah i- um, color, it's U- it won't be U-V, um but what color is the closest to that, like in this right here?


S2: there?


S3: yeah, i mean yo- ultraviolet's correct for that, [S2: uh, okay ] i mean ultraviolet's the closest quote unquote color cuz it's, [S2: okay ] we can't really give color to violet, you know


S2: okay, (xx) and seventeen, [S3: okay ] five hundred


S3: five hundred so, what's, what is it, five hundred and seventeen? so uhh, you know it's


S2: i know it's part of the other one


S3: yeah so let's see there's about f- (xx) ruler or a pen actually if you see, yeah so what would happen here we have uh, okay, so here's the distance, and this is about halfway, you [S2: this would be the green ] know it's a little less than half it's yeah, it's right in the green, (xx) [S2: okay ] so


S2: i'm still i still (wanna make sense) (xx) i know it so i can see it (xx)


S3: oh no okay, well yeah but this is telling you it's in the green, now, but see you better, put that in the green, and i'll explain in a second.


S2: okay.


S3: let's uh yeah i- it's crazy, yeah, you know, laws of physics are wrong, <S2: LAUGH> it's crazy, alright okay, a thousand where's a thousand right here.


S2: it's gonna be infrared, probably [S3: right exactly ] you know, okay, (xx...) yeah that's (sort of interesting) (xx)


<PAUSE:06>
S3: mm, yeah, yeah. okay so let's let's think about this for a second. while we're (changing) the sun's supposed to be green? that's crazy. what's uh, what's going on here. well, it's different for this, so wha- what's the temperature? fifty-eight hundred. mkay, this is, here we are, that's that's cool. this is about six thou- it's about the temperature of the sun we'll move this over a little (xx) well, if you take a look at this, okay? this is mini- green at the maximum but, look at how much the yellow, red blue, a big conglomeration you know i mean it's i mean if it if it was like, if it went like this, and if_ i'm not gonna write in your book but you know if you know it went like, if if the spectrum actually went like this and went straight up here and was a real sharp peak, you'd see a green sun. but because it's, emitting all these colors they mix together i mean just like you know you, you've done that and like you've seen a red blue a red and blue light made [S2: (pink?) ] yeah, or whatever color i [S2: yeah ] you know green and blue make yellow, and that's why, [S2: okay ] and see i mean, and see it like you know green greens and yellows are the three mo- colors that are most given off, mid orange and red gives it a little,


S2: oh, (i thought this was what you were talking about.) alright, thank you


S3: no problem.


S2: (xx)


S3: yeah yeah and, only one thing i want to point out to you, this, this is technically right, you just, you just probably wanna_ y- who's your T-A?


S2: John Spar.


S3: John yeah, tell John. yeah just tell John (xx) a- and he's not gonna, you know. you might wanna just mention to him just put, this really didn't have a color so i just put the closest color there (was)


<2 SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS FOLLOW; TIMES NOTED><CONVERSATION IIA: 30:17 - 64:05>
S1: yeah, like i think i'm gonna fail, the test, i don't care


S9: you're gonna fail?


S1: yes


S9: what are you gonna fail?


S1: the G-R-E. [S5: oh ] but i don't care, i'll just find a job [S5: okay ] it'll be okay.


S9: i'll fail with you.


S1: (people are) allowed to fail, it'll be fine... i don't care. if i fail it's okay. i'm okay with that.


S7: <LAUGH> you talk like that it ma- it makes me think that, i can't watch the Simpsons after s- you know <SS: LAUGH> i need to go home, and study.


S1: here i'll make you, i'm not gonna do any G-R-E studying tonight so don't worry about it.


S7: tonight [S1: yeah ] tomorrow


S1: <LAUGH> you'll be okay.


S7: you know it really sucks that (i think) what's his name's test is this week. i mean but i really want to do a lot of studying and then, like


S1: i know i can't believe anybody_ we were like uh [SU-m: G-R-E okay, (i'm quitting) ] (uh, your) test is now and wha- what does this say? derive this this is like (xx)


S7: really sucks, you know you really think about it, we have a test, right after and right before the G-R-E. (really sucks)


S1: very (xx)


S7: yeah the, one that's this Friday this Friday


S3: and what's what's the one after it?


S3: Christmas [S3: oh ] (you know) (xx) thanks, thanks Professor Kent...


S7: you tell her that. [SU-m: yeah. ] (xx) increase the percentage by us failing it is gonna help you.


S8: i know i should go in there and say hey you know what, by by you having the test on the the last (Christmas) day, you know it's gonna make you the better grad student cuz everyone else is gonna do worse <LAUGH>


S7: yeah, better [S1: (who is this?) ] huh


S1: who?


S8: you jus- you should go thank Kent [S1: oh <LAUGH>] because you know [S7: exactly ] (xx) help him out


S1: yeah, grad school what's that? <LAUGH> i am so dumb, i'm just kidding


S7: ohh i'm so afraid.


S1: you've you've been studying, you're okay you're you're okay, you're way ahead of me.


S8: why are you afraid?


S7: fear dude.


S8: fear of what?


S7: fear.


S1: you <LAUGH> you'll beat me out. i'll make your percentage higher.


S3: <LAUGH> i'm a, you gotta (can't) worry about it too much. i mean if you go if you go double A-S and you just meet seriously if you meet people at these institutions, and you know you tell 'em what you're doing i i i honestly believe that, i honestly believe like, if i met someone, from a institution and i knew like, i knew their capabilities, or like someone i knew knew their capabilities and told me and i trusted that person, i would take that a heck of a lot more (xx)


S1: i wonder if i like applied to like really a, good graduate schools with like really crappy <LAUGH> G-R-E scores if they would even, [S4: Harvard ] still consider me, <LAUGH> they're like um she's had, like she just had three bad days. <LAUGH>


S9: three bad days <LAUGH>


S7: remember, remember those uh, those, top places uh what was it like, throu- Cal Tech and Harvard, and stuff they said that, [S1: like, ninetieth percentile ] sometimes, sometimes they lower their standards into the eighties [S1: to like, eighties ] from the nineties yeah, so remember, y- y- you might have a chance.


S1: i don't wanna go to Harvard.


S9: you wanna be, what i think is hilarious is that most students get like forty percent on the physics G-R-E, like who? the only people who are getting eighties and nineties are super freaks and they're like, <S1: LAUGH> are like, foreign. because foreign students [SU-m: mhm ] [SU-m: yeah ] and i've been told that foreign students like study for the G-R-E a lot [S7: for like a year, yeah ] more than we are, yeah


S1: yeah, i think that they_ oh, i mean i don't know, i'm not really sure but i think that they maybe have classes that are more oriented towards the G-R-E too.


S9: yeah, solving their problems


S4: this is on the G-R-E's (about.) [SU-f: i don't know ] (Greenhills studied it.)


S3: (well then) Grand Rapids. [SU-m: the the guy goes to Aquinas ] [SU-f: ooh ] the the guy that uh what do you think of that?


S3: yeah, i'm from Battle Creek so, that's cool


SU-f: Grand Rapids?


S3: yeah.


SU-f: i lived there all my life.


S3: <LAUGH> and so you think <LAUGH> (that's cool)


SU-f: i love Grand Rapids.

S1: well you were mad at_ what? the cart? (xx) oh yeah.


SU-m: what?


S1: you know what? <SS: LAUGH> so we gotta go buy the, G-R-E software.


SU-m: yeah the, well why don't we, i'll do it right now i'll get on the net and i'll [S1: mkay ] order (xx)


S1: okay


S3: no don't order it we gotta go to a store or something cuz that'll take forever

S3: we should buy that with S-A-S's money.


SU-f: yeah


SU-5: what?


S7: seriously


S8: because it's for everybody


SS: buy what?


S7: it's only twenty bucks (xx)


S3: G-R-E software. cuz everyone has


S1: okay


SU-f: because y- what are you gonna do with it afterwards like,


S3: exactly, you know


S1: yeah we should just pass it on


SU-7: but it is for everybody, [S3: yeah i- ] will be for everybody and we'll burn the C-D's.


<SS: LAUGH>
SU-f: yeah yeah yeah yeah


S4: so you pirate software?


<SU-f: LAUGH>
S1: no


S3: maybe.


SU-m: we- we- we'll pirate it. we'll sell it on the (Priceline) <SS: LAUGH>


S4: that'd be a cool thing to have up here, that it says like, in front of the library.


<SS: LAUGH>
SU-f: yeah.


S7: damn, <LAUGH> (xx)


S3: <LAUGH> where's my pen? i'm just a pyro i like to burn things <LAUGH> i'm so sorry guys


S1: we're like, immature, so uh, i don't understand how to do this cuz this is incredibly, uh, done for you


S3: but seriously guys, you guys i i have to get some help because i just, i like to burn things i'm a pyro.


<SS: LAUGH>
S1: yeah after we take it in we'll just, burn it all.


S3: burn the C-D <LAUGH> oh


SU-m: i bet we can sell it for fifteen bucks (xx) <SU-m: LAUGH> E-T-S software, fire


S3: yeah... okay


S3: si- si since it's (anihi- complaint) bu- bue- (buena, buena) dumb ass.


<SU-f: LAUGH><UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S3: what are you guys doing?


SU-m: i don't know (xx) but we're reading


SU-m: (xx) they're talking about a conspiracy.


S3: a conspir- the alien bodies at the top of the ninth floor <S1: LAUGH> remember the remember the room that has the alien bodies [SU-m: mhm ] ninth floor <LAUGH>


S1: actually there was this one night, somebody and i were going on the third floor, and we walked out and there was this like, um, scaffold kinda, in the hall, right? <LAUGH> probably wasn't scaffold cuz scaffold are usually on buildings but it was like pipes and stuff, and there was like, plastic around it, it totally looked like


S3: (like they were) housing alien bodies?


S1: mhm.


<PAUSE:09>
S1: this reminds me of uh, not really but this uh, Tom Clancy book i read. and there was like all these codes that they said to each other you know, well they actually wrote down everything <LAUGH> they were saying.


S3: uhuh. makes me realize how much i (xx) (mess around)


S1: <READING> what's the deal? i don't understand wh- this problem is already done. <PAUSE WHILE READING> i don't understand, this first problem is like, i can't figure out how to do it because it's all, i think it's all done, like, in the first like in two lines, so i think i'm doing it wrong <LAUGH> (xx) strange


S9: okay, [S1: okay ] did you write your abstract already?


S1: no i can't write that in here, i don't have any paper to write it on. i'm gonna do it when i get home.


S9: shit i'm just gonna have to do it on my paper because i don't wanna write it on this this paper, i can't write an abstract of this, because i think i'll i'm gonna read the abstract and then write an abstract, i can't do that.


S1: summarize the abstract <LAUGH>


S9: but that's silly.


S1: <LAUGH> seriously, just summarize the abstract... i mean, actually i don't think you would really have to read the entire paper cuz they probably, present most of the important results in the abstract, y- all you have to do is like maybe have a background, and, conclusion.


SU-m: mine didn't have an abstract. so i i don't know what i should do, like i'm trying


S1: pick a new paper. i'd pick a new paper [SU-m: really? ] cuz [SU-m: i was thinking about ] mine like, was about two pages long.


SU-m: yeah, your, paper was two pages long?


S1: so, yeah, actually i should, like rewrite my abstract for the summer, or something.


SU-m: yeah that's a good (xx)


S1: see i always break, (up the talk) via detail [SU-m: mm, yeah ] jus- just break into it, we present this, you know?


S3: really? [S1: yeah ] cuz that's what i that's what i always (xx)


S1: although actually,


S9: did he say you could do that?


S1: he said, that you should give some background, [SU-m: yeah ] i didn't even know where my abstract, is like anymore but maybe i should just rewrite that


S3: your abstract?


S1: from last years, double A-S


S3: oh yeah (xx)


SU-f: yeah i should turn in mine from, for this year's double A-S,


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S3: oh you know what? (xx) remember writing one uh, (on the subject of) Stephen Hawking.


S7: what? [S3: Steve- ] (you're trying to get) Stephen Hawking (xx)


S3: yeah.


S7: did he have? like what do you mean the applying the


S3: well no i mean he's just like he did some [S7: (xx) ] work and it's it's just bullshit but, i'm sorry Charlie and so that's uh,


S7: actually


SU-m: i proved like i proved his theory wrong, i got i got into a fight with him the other day and he, he just, he told me that and i, the matrix identity was zero. and i, i i couldn't take it. [S3: yeah su- ] i told him listen, if you want our friendship to continue, you have to tell me that that's nonzero. and uh, [S3: but i said all that ] he's i mean, he thinks he's (xx) [S3: yeah i know ] he's typing on the computer, sorry (xx) anxious


S3: i know dude you shoulda seen Li Ying dude, Li Ying just tore Stephen Hawking apart, [S7: really? ] yeah Li Ying's like, and so Stephen Hawking like is just talking and Li Ying goes, there's this thing he goes clearly, you're wrong, <LAUGH> s- starts writing on up on the board and starts writing like, you know quantum elec- relativistic quantum electrodynamics, (xx) electrochromodynamics.


SU-f: Li Ying did this?


S3: yeah Li Ying.


SU-f: yeah yeah


S3: (xx) i wouldn't be surprised at all, Li you know Li Ying could probably, Li Ying can do anything. (xx) i'd be like Li Ying i need a gra- antigravity uh hovercraft for, this weekend he probably


S7: (xx) give me a couple minutes.


S3: <LAUGH> here you are, (it's a launch)


SU-m: yeah i gotta no i got an hour i got an hour lunch break hold on, <LAUGH> i'll work on it.


<SS: LAUGH>
S3: (xx)


SU-m: quickly (xx) build something. he actually builds it


<S3: LAUGH><PAUSE:04>
SU-f: did you put something in my, in (xx)


S3: yeah i put it in yours instead of mine, i put like a, i folded up a piece of paper put it in mine, (xx)


SU-f: oh okay cuz i thought, you had, remember we had talked about that paper? [S3: oh yeah, ] i forgot [S3: yeah ] (xx)


S3: about these grad schools and stuff? [S3: uh, yeah i ] there should be, yeah


SU-f: oh yeah cuz Adam was telling me there was in the paper that


S3: yeah well there should be one that's exactly like that (i think) in my folder, and then (xx)


S4: i might have one in mine as well you can have.


S8: oh do you? if you could make a ph- photocopy


S3: actually you know what, there's one floating around here,


S4: is there one in mine...? [S3: <LAUGH> (xx) Li Ying ] you shou- you can just have that, cuz i don't need it.


S3: (xx) L- Li Ying (xx) <LAUGH>


S3: yeah and need an antigravity (i, i need a)


S8: need an antigravity unit for uh, the space station by one.


S3: <LAUGH> give me two hours, you come back, (he goes) give me another hour, i had to build uh, (xx) super- ca- superconducting (supercollider.)


SU-8: he's like, i i kind of need more (food, i'm, you'll) let me use it, two weeks from now, Tuesday...


S3: (xx) formal training <SS: LAUGH> Li Ying, have you been working?


SU-m: yeah your brother tell ya? um, we went to, you know that, you remember that, you ever do the monkey problem in uh thermo?


S3: yeah the the (xx)


SU-m: the probability yeah, [SU-m: monkey on my ] and they ha- they have a play on that, Friday night [S1: what's that? ] they had a play like that Friday night. basically it was like three monkeys, um [S3: yeah ] typing ad infinitum on, and eventually creating (xx) typing at uh


S3: it was yeah he told me about the play and uh, he's trying (xx)


SU-f: and where's the little photocopier?


S3: it's like in this other room where the coffeemaker and stuff is, in there


SU-f: okay, yeah, thanks.


S3: what?


S7: she was just uh, making (xx) over there


S1: i didn't do it.


SU-m: did you do it?


S1: no, i didn't do it.


SU-m: i'm gonna do it


S1: nobody saw that movie called The Rocketman or whatever or


SU-m: what was that?


S3: the Disney movie?


S4: The Rocketeer?


S1: yeah


S3: yeah it was pretty stupid.


S1: did you see that? it was so funny it was so dumb it was stupid, [S3: yeah ] i mean it was so dumb it


S3: i i- it's been playing on Disney for a while, [S1: oh really? ] i saw some glimpses of it but i really didn't get much (xx)


S1: it's really uh like inaccurate. [S3: y- yeah y- ] incre- see my sister told me it was really funny, so i just kinda suspended my disbelief and watched it and i- i thought it was really funny.


SU-m: wait what was this? (what do you mean) really inaccurate?


S1: it's like he's going to Mars on the next like, [S1: yeah ] he's like a complete like idiot


S3: and he like doesn't fall s- doesn't get into, stasis and he's like, hanging around for like two years or something. i


S1: the funniest thing ever was when he got in the fight with monkey [S3: yeah, it's a, yeah ] <LAUGH> d- do you reme- you didn't see that part? okay, so, like it was just really funny like he gets in a fight with a monkey other people are talking outside and he's just seen at the back throwing the monkey around <LAUGH> it was really f- and then when they turn around he's like holding it. you know how it um did you see any of it?


S3: yeah i saw parts i was just (xx)


S1: did you see any parts where he said it wasn't me in it?


S3: no


S1: okay cuz like, any time something happens, he's like wasn't me <LAUGH> and it was really funny so i've been saying that a lot, but um [S3: y- it wasn't me? ] cuz like huh?


S3: oh i was just, i was thinking is you we- say he goes to Mars or something.


S1: yeah.


S3: i just saw Superman Four.


S1: yeah and he went to Mars?


S3: no no no no in Superman Four him, and Nuclearman you know the, Lex Luthor Luthor (xx) [SU-m: yeah it was just on T-V ] yeah yeah that's (right) and, remember like Lana Lane or some or Lana something


S1: Lois Lane?


S3: no no it's Lois Lane but no there's another girl Lana right?


S7: yeah that takes over the paper (xx)


S3: yeah Nuclearman, La- uh, [S1: was she in the story? ] uh, no, uh anyways she goes, she, like Nuclearman wants her (xx) herself sh- sh- she


S1: she's got the black pants on.


S3: yeah exactly, [SU-m: and he walks into her office and she's like (laying on the desk) ] yeah exactly, you know and, pulls out [SU-m: and says ] he pulls out a few hundred dollar bills and she's like you're mine i'm yours.


S1: you mine <LAUGH> hey, i-


S3: well anyway this, the thing that was, she, he like grabbed her and, took her off into space, <SU-m: LAUGH> and she was like up in space like you know and, the first thing i thought, was like, that's stupid, if she was all in space like that she'd either explode because of the pressure differentials [SU-m: yeah ] or, her blood would boil because, okay it's an ideal gas [S1: <LAUGH> yeah ] you know?


SU-m: but Superman does that too in part one. he takes what's her name into space


S1: that's cuz he's Superman it was Rocketman anyway so we get into this stupid movie


SU-m: i was gonna say, just imagine Charlie, how does rotating the earth backwards in time reverse- or backwards reverse time?


S3: well if you're gonna go


SU-m: let's think about that.


S1: um, anyway in The Rocketman, so like, there's this really big astronaut guy who's really pompous and so like he's m- made up this speech and everything for everybody he gets on Mars you know he's, going down the ladder and the, idiot guy's above him and he, slips and falls and accidentally is the first one on Mars and then he hi- the first thing he says is, it wasn't me, i didn't do it. <LAUGH> it was really funny and so like had these headlines that say, words from Mars it wasn't me <S7: LAUGH> it was really funny. okay i'm just, [S3: pretty good ] [S7: uhuh ] okay but you have to see it. it was funny


S3: so you've been studying for the G-R-E i see huh?


S1: no, this was in the summer i watched it. [S3: uhuh ] yeah i should've been studying for the G-R-E then but <LAUGH>


SU-3: yeah


<PAUSE:15>
S3: when did you finish this paper?


S7: what? [S3: when did you ] this is uh, about two summers ago, actually


S3: and you just finished it August ninety-eight?


S7: well no, submitted, uh, when i grad- when i (xx) but i jus- it just got published [S3: oh ] (xx) in ninety-eight?


S3: it takes two years to publish?


S7: no it's uh, i left not two years ago two summers ago so, it was summer of ninety-seven that i, we finished it, and then [S3: oh ] they submitted it, like a couple months after that and then, [S3: alright ] (xx) and so they submitted it in October and so that like, we- well, let's see.


S1: four years, no publications, same research [S7: oh yeah? ] <LAUGH> have to redo (xx) something every time i turn around


SU-m: well, you know (say- say-) actually like (xx) has been like saying we've published like (forever) you know like, like we've got an abstract and stuff like we got into the postgraduate stuff and i asked him this year, i asked him now, i said do you want to publish before double A-S you know like publish be- and he's like oh i don't think we've done enough to publish it <S1: LAUGH> so yeah i know i've [S1: i need to do some work, but i don't have time ] like designed (xx) and i like, i've, done like so much work with him and stuff it's really stupid like, even if they, i feel like even if they publish it at this point (there's) like it'd be really really cool to put out a paper anyway so it's like, kinda (xx)


S1: i'm never gonna finish my research before i graduate. [S3: what's that, w- (exactly) ] i mean i'm may be near being done with one of the fields and there's only, six, main fields left <SU-m: LAUGH> plus an additional like nine.


S7: yeah


S3: i yeah i'm not gonna be able to get mine done because they're not gonna get the new telescope out [S1: (so weird) ] until like, next term. and the data's not gonna be,


S7: Benson and i just keep doing new things <S1: LAUGH> he's like oh yeah (you know,) main task do this now.


S1: the reversible heat, okay, it's just impossible to read, words like (that small) what are you writing your abstract?


S7: yeah, i'll be writing it out (actually)


S1: with a pen? isn't that hard to do? <LAUGH>


S7: (i use a) pen. i can't stand pencils.


S1: i have uh, worked with you both it seems satisfactory, [SU-m: awesome. ] i have uh, not done any problems though, (xx) maybe now i'll do an abstract <PAUSE:07><ANSWERS QUESTION FROM CONVERSATION IIB; 52:21>


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S1: maybe you guys should be in a group of your (xx) like (flagstones) not to make, (joke)


S3: not to trul- trivi- trivia- trivialize you.


S1: but, it be more funny, i'm just k- <LAUGH> that wouldn't be funny. fighting is not good.


SU-m: uhuh


<PAUSE:18>
S1: <WHISPERING> oh i can't read it


<PAUSE:18>
S4: do you know how to find the probability of the (spin one)


S1: of spin what?


S4: spin one? and uh probability of S-C plus H and S-C minus H? I don't know how to circle it, this is what i_ wouldn't it be, twenty-five percent?


S1: is it uh something like this? um, okay


S4: i- i- for for two just for a two-dimensional (spin one F) [S1: mhm ] i- i- if this is your A it's like um, it's uh A minus B squared equals, the probability (xx)


S1: is it something like like where you've got the integral of like S-H-bar over, omega, times psi-squared, or something like that? cuz that energy, equals S-H-bar-omega, and then um, like for the probability you have to do this over, (i don't know) it's the psi squared or whatever? [S3: whoa ] does that look like the same thing?


S3: familiar? no no <LAUGH>


S4: the- there's this part for uh, like, if you measure it in (C) so this is for uh, this is one half particle. [S1: okay ] where it's just, these two equations. [S1: okay ] alright, it's A plus B squared (xx) oh okay.


S1: you've already figured it out?


S4: okay o- okay okay, i guess so. well, maybe, i'll try it and see what happens.


S1: i'm gonna like, hang over your shoulder <LAUGH> for a second.


S4: okay.


<PAUSE:07>
SU-f: what are you doing? [S4: hm? ] (xx)


S4: uh, this is homework we, it's kinda like our exam that we just took, so he wants us to do, kinda the same stuff again. Barney Cleaver and Mick Wal, (they're so weird)


S1: i've never done this, that's cuz everything we learned in nonintegrated quantum was completely uh, nuts


<SS: LAUGH><PAUSE:04>
S4: (xx)


S1: um, yeah, (xx)


S4: <LAUGH> really?


S10: (xx) like Yao, Yao like doesn't teach at all


S1: (Katie) you're with me


S10: Yao was like


S1: Yao was like Yao


S10: Yao like talked to the board, and like wrote down scribbles, and was like, finally three weeks into it turned around and was like this was blah blah blah he was like back to the board, and i was like <S3: LAUGH> that was (what, like) (xx) something and like <S3: LAUGH> alright. so if it's Yao i wouldn't take it, only because you're not going to learn anything either way,


S3: yeah, i i'll only take, it if it's someone who'll (do a good)


S10: you know, [S3: yeah ] like if it's Chad, Chad actually would [S3: (Chad's good?) ] probably be very very good at it.


S3: okay


S1: Chad drives me crazy.


S10: yeah, i don't know if you'd wanna be graded by Chad but,


<S3: LAUGH>
S1: i'm afraid, of my grade that i got from Chad


S10: Chad's awesome, i got an A on my thesis. <LAUGH>[S1: that's good ] so.


<CONVERSATION IIAa 56:39-57:04>
S3: you got an A on your thesis?


S10: yeah, i wrote my thesis with Chad


S3: okay. so you've done your thesis and (you're just) (xx) okay.


S10: cuz i though i was gonna graduate last year, but i decided (xx) astro major and i decided that (and i just) (xx) like i, am done [S3: okay ] you know like i'm i'm taking classes since i was like, i put them off purposely so, (like you)

S7: and what about Christopher, dude and smile oh really? <LAUGH>


S1: i- if what? if he said what?


SU-m: if he said


S3: (xx) (xx) like somehow goes oh he thinks he's God's gift to women, well what if you know gets some like, quote you know nerdy physicists (xx) well he just thinks he's God's gift to relativistic magnetohydrodynamics


S1: <LAUGH> you should invest your energy into something else. i'm just kidding


SU-m: what are you talking about?


S1: nothing


S3: loo- look at our our garbage i think we filled up two <LAUGH> (xx)


S9: i know it's really


SU-7: we need another one, we need another one, that's good <LAUGH>


SU-7: (xx)


S9: no, we need to get those emptied it stinks over there.


S1: you wanna go ov- you stick your nose in there? <LAUGH> just kidding


S3: who who empties them who's supposed to


S8: Sandy's the only one (xx)


SU-7: Sandy. let's get one those big garden, ba- things <SU-m: LAUGH> and just leave it in here


S3: what?


S8: let's get one of those big garden things


S7: i saw him today, i just don't think he's coming in.


S3: who is that?


S4: who Sparett? i think M-CAT or someth-


S7: it's not m- i'm not gonna worry about it. [S4: hey ] oh wait a minute that's mine. <SS: LAUGH>[S8: are you sure you're not gonna worry about it? ] dude that is mine, it's one of mine.

S4: that was (good) that was good


S1: i don't know why i didn't go for like, ten. i was trying to be tough.


S4: cuz n- like g- if you set it for lower, i- i- like you can do like more the s- even (in) the same day it like you just get like, you get used to it. (i like what you should d-)


S7: if you set it for like lower


S1: i did a lot, of sit-ups last week. [S3: oh yeah. ] so like i- i don't know it's really [S3: yeah ] like, i kinda just have a tendency to do a lot at once and then like the next week i can't do any [S3: yeah ] cuz it i feel like my muscles are just gonna rip apart. <LAUGH>


S7: yeah like um i i showed her the one [S3: oh that one machine, yeah ] machine you were on yeah it made like her almost hurt herself <LAUGH> he had a thing like right here


S1: what happened you were


S7: (xx)


S1: you stuck your head underneath there, that bar?


S3: yeah, yeah


S7: underneath that thing underneath the bar


S3: i was laying and there was this (right here i was)


S7: and thes- guy this guy came and he was like whoa you're gonna hurt yourself he like lifts it off <LAUGH>


S1: like i'm an astrophysicist <LAUGH>


S3: that's what i that's why astronomers in the weight room <LAUGH> that's why i said let me sho- let me, i'll let you do it first [S1: yeah ] because i didn't i didn't want you to kill yourself


S7: i was like i was li- how the hell do you do this? <LAUGH>


S3: this guy turned around i go to get a drink of water i turn around the guy's like you'd hurt yourself.


S1: no really uh uh uh


S3: that's a little exaggeration there [S7: i don't know i'm trying to remember it but, ] i think, i got out of it and he's like oh oh that's not that's not how you do it or something like that.


S1: you're like <LAUGH>


S7: (yeah) oh that's not how you do it that's what he said, i thought he said


S3: oh it's not it doesn't matter i don't care but no it's just it was so funny


S1: he said you're obviously not a kinesiologist <LAUGH>


S3: yeah yeah i know, i know


S7: obviously you're not, physically inept obviously you use your brain for something other than that.


S3: you're like, all my body is is to carry my brain.


<SS: LAUGH>
S1: what'd you say?

<SS: LAUGH>
SU-f: you guys were beat up a lot as kids weren't you?


S3: i have a symbiotic relationship between my body and my brain <LAUGH>


S1: huh?


S3: i have a symbiotic relationship between my body and my brain


S9: so that's like (this is that?)


S3: it's like [SU-m: they need each other ] like my body is just a host for my brain <LAUGH>[S1: oh, okay ] [S9: okay, good thank you ] like it leaves hosts when the_ when it's done you know.


S1: that's cool. that'd be really cool if your brain did that. no i'm just kidding <SU-f: LAUGH> i'd be afraid, i'd be like oh God here comes Charlie's brain, gonna take off my head.


S4: it jumps out of his chest or something?


S1: yeah, that'd be scary. w- wouldn't it be like frightening, when we were just like, head and n- never mind [SU-f: what? ] you could see our brains <LAUGH> going <SOUND EFFECT> yeah okay okay


S7: you could judge each other on the size of the brains (xx) see it, like mine's bigger than yours. your numbers, your C-C level, how big your brain is


S1: i got like a eight hundred C-C brain <LAUGH>


S3: how's, that's big


S1: no it's not. [S3: oh it's n- ] they're usually like eleven hundred


S3: oh, okay i'm thinking seven hundred (xx)


S1: te- a thousand usually

S3: did you see the uh, the uh, the uh what's it called in one of the, the Far Sides, he uh, it it's like, the b- the cops break into this thing and say okay who's the brains in this organization? everyone's got small heads and one guy's got a huge head <SS: LAUGH> so


S1: just cuz he had a big head doesn't mean_ i mean [S3: Neanderthals had bigger heads ] Neanderthals had a much bigger head and they were not, necessarily smart but we don't really know because they're not the uh, savage that they had been thought [S3: mhm ] to be <SOMEONE COMES TO DOOR> hi come on in <SS: LAUGH>


S3: what was that?


S1: oh my god i think i had whoa that's, my problem, [SU-m: (xx) ] twenty ounces of caffeine.

S3: (xx) not without laughing for two hours?


<SU-f: LAUGH>
S1: no i think that was equal to one can of Surge what?


S3: you had, two two hours of nonstop laughing? (xx)


S5: did you (xx)


<SU-f: LAUGH>
S1: one time i had a NoDoz and i laughed for twenty minutes straight no stopping.


SU-m: an overdose of what?


S5: you had a what?


S1: no- a NoDoz, i was like <SOUND EFFECT>


S5: <LAUGH> if i was around you i woulda killed you.


<SS: LAUGH>
S1: try not to, be crazy


S4: so what are you up to tonight?

S7: get outta here (sweet) Ch- Charlie are you afraid that yours doesn't hold up to par with the rest of ours, is that it?


S3: no, i'm just seeing what i can do here to improve this


S7: yeah, whatever (xx) <LAUGH> you are the Charlie (who is high and strong) [S3: huh? ] you are the Charlie, you (are high and strong) <LAUGH><PAUSE:05> okay you know what? (xx) down the hall?

S7: you had your power ring, you transformed. yeah yeah see you (xx) i uh, you going to the meet?


SU-f: i'm going to definitely try (to go to the meet) (xx) Tuesday and Thursday, Thursday and Wednesday (xx) i'm, i'm trying to make it at least (xx) as possible, (xx) [S7: uhuh ] and i'm having (xx) to help me somewhat (xx) [S7: okay ] but i should be here.


S7: alright see you


SU-f: okay. i'll see you tomorrow morning.


S7: okay.


<CONVERSATION IIB: 34:27 - 61:45>
S9: (xx) equals... well, okay that's actually, that's actually more accurate okay so then, (xx) and it turns into this (xx) [S6: yeah ] and (xx) and then


<PAUSE WHILE READING>
S9: well... okay, here you have, (xx) okay, here we need to draw a triangle.


S6: (xx)


S9: well, y- it's gonna be (kind of an) elongated triangle okay? so we have, we have the center of the nebula (xx) and we have the (remnant here...) so, like, you know that this distance, (xx) point-three-one parsecs


S6: so that's what we just, figured out


S9: we just figured out, okay and so here's the earth... the triangle like this. now, what else do you have that can help (you?)


S6: (would) the diameter?


S9: mhm


S6: right here?


S9: so that's this area down here. <PAUSE:08> what else do you have... and this is what you wanna find.


<PAUSE:04>
S6: so we have, (xx) [S9: yeah ] it'd be like cosine?


S9: yeah you know you know it's really uh, tangent (xx) [S6: oh, okay ] so you have, one-point-three-one, over, (xx) equals one?


<PAUSE:05>
S6: (is that,) oh the tan of five-point-two... (xx) i don't remember and all that stuff.


S9: well you mighta used the small angle formula. [S6: (xx) tangent ] what?


S6: i, i have the tangent.


S9: P, oh, but um, that's not degrees, that's, that's... they actually want it.


<PAUSE:47>
S9: (xx) remember, tried that formula for a little while, remember where that was?


S6: um, page nineteen?


S9: nineteen.


<PAUSE:11>
S6: (xx) make, (thirty-eight) and then (xx) forty eight,


S9: no no no no not


S6: not that one


S9: nope


S6: this one the one i found in the notes?


S9: small angle formula? does that sound familiar?


S6: oh that was in the front.


S9: yeah, that's what i thought. <LAUGH>


S6: yeah, in chapter two or one... page eight or nine.


S9: um, page eight or nine?


S6: yeah


S9: okay i think that's what it was <PAUSE:04> yes. <LAUGH> (xx) okay here you have um... you have this D, you have this angle... [S6: right, ] and you have, li- so you can, solve it two different ways you can use a tangent or you can use this. now, for this want the, um, the angle has to be (xx) (i mean) the angle has to be in (degrees) um, so [S6: (xx) ] you could do it two different ways and you should get (xx) for it, because this is kind of an approximation problem.


S6: well how do i switch it from arc minutes to degrees?


S9: um, i don't know (xx)


S6: how many arc seconds?


<PAUSE:06>
S9: one degree is sixty arc minutes [S6: okay so, ] this so, so one arc minute is, equals how many degrees?


S6: um one-sixtieth?


S9: mhm


S6: okay, so then we have arc (xx) minutes? and <UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH> okay so i got this crazy number.


S9: okay, take the tangent of that.


S6: the tangent, (xx)


<PAUSE:04>
S9: oh sorry


S6: that's okay this looks like (xx) alright


S9: let's make a short one (look like this.) um, okay so you have, (xx)


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S9: this you have to use, pi... um, cuz this is the whole, like this is, this is one-point- four. this whole [S6: oh ] thing is one-point-four. you hafta use half of that


<PAUSE:10>
S6: i'm totally (xx)


S9: you're doing it (xx) okay so this is so okay, um, okay you know that this is what's this (xx) point-three-one... this is... and this is five-point-two. so this, makes a triangle... three-point-six (arc) minutes and, this


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S9: yeah i i think, this is, this is gonna (xx) answer there and i'm trying to figure out why this one's (xx)


S6: so this one's wrong?


S9: one of 'em is wrong, (xx) <LAUGH> um, it doesn't have to be (xx) no <PAUSE:05> this one you use the whole (xx)


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S9: (xx) because like, this is pretty close, you know?


S6: um, what did i switch? (xx) i switched the angle. [S9: right ] arc minutes (xx) arc seconds.


S6: mhm?.. so the (xx) uhh, <LAUGH> it would be six.


S9: well, for this one you wanna use (xx)


S6: um, sixteen?


<PAUSE:28>
S9: um... times three-point, oh-one? okay this is the number i get here.


S6: (xx) this one different?


S9: yeah i get s- the


S6: to the two?


S9: (xx) yeah


S6: well what was i doing?


S9: i don't know.


S6: (xx) i just don't know how to <SS: LAUGH> (xx) so it's the same exact thing then.


S9: yeah, actually but this one you should, redo using, this [S6: the halves? ] the halves because that's actually more accurate than the triangle (one) you know.


S6: okay. so, (xx)


S9: yeah it's like a (xx)


S6: okay good, i was gonna do that later. [S5: okay ] (xx) what else?


S9: did you have another question?


S6: oh yeah i have lots of questions (xx) i don't know. i missed the (xx) one day and i don't know what's up. um, number two, it's (xx) remnants. and i had something (xx) neutrons that were, uh


<PAUSE:09>
S9: (have you studied) neutron stars?


S6: yeah cuz these are, solar masses (xx) is that wrong?


S9: what about black holes?


S6: oh, well this one could be, right? but what about that one? i thought it had to be more than ten.


S9: um, technically more than three, but um [S6: oh really? ] <LAUGH> yeah, but um, this is more likely to be the black hole, because this is, heavier, and it's also younger [S6: what is the? ] so it's (xx)


S6: it's younger? how do you know it's younger?


S9: well, i- because um, it's more massive, you know if it's more massive then i- it's evolving, more quickly. [S6: oh okay it will be ] so, younger one it, gets its final, (xx) its final state.


S6: and what does the temperature have to do (xx) oh that's the hottest one (xx) right? [S9: mhm ] does that mean, it's gonna go quicker?


S9: yeah cuz it's burning things faster. [S6: okay ] like higher, higher temperatures equals higher


S6: so that would mean (it'll be a) black hole (instead of a neutron.)


S9: probably i mean you know it's gonna be one or the other but since it is twenty-four masses, [S6: okay (xx) ] you still, like neutron stars (can) only be up to about, three, solar masses?


S6: oh


S1: between two and three


S9: yeah neutron stars can be between two and three, the thing is like if you have a ten, ten solar mass, star, it's gonna lose a lot of its mass at the end of its life you know when it goes through a giant and it like, goes supernova and stuff and so if it loses, you know seven solar masses it can be a neutron star but this one, it's gotta lose seventeen solar masses, at the least <LAUGH>[S6: oh, okay, ] so you know it's probably not gonna lose that much, [S6: okay ] so it's more likely to be a black hole.


S6: okay and this one, we don't know? i mean what does this have to do with it. like does that help me tell?


S9: this one?


S6: yeah


S9: um, well you know, it's gonna be a little older, we know it has (seven different) chemical composition <PAUSE:05> i would say based, on the mass here, i wouldn't worry as much [S6: okay ] about the classification you might wanna check with your T-A about, (xx)


S6: i don't know what i did. i took off the wrong part again... okay.


<PAUSE:05>
S6: so this one i don't know about? (i just guess?)


S9: yeah this one i- well, (xx) what do you know about the evolution of stars?


S6: not much


<SS: LAUGH>
S9: well, do you, have your book?


S6: yeah, where did it go?


S9: is this your book?


S6: yeah.


S9: really? you guys still use the fourth edition?


S6: yeah (we still have that one.)


S9: oh... um, do you know which chapter it is?


S6: twenty-three or four. (xx) look at (earlier) today but i still don't know... twenty-three


<PAUSE:06>
S9: the deaths of stars?


S6: twenty-two (or whatever,) [S5: let's see ] that's what i was looking through and that was not helping.


S9: yeah this book, has some, sort of, like it doesn't, lay things out so that (xx) can, um, <PAUSE:11> um (xx) have twenty-four, twenty-five (xx) is a neutron star [S6: okay ] so it ca- like both of these could kinda go either way. [S6: okay ] you know, it's more likely to be one than the other but, you know it has to blow off a lot of mass... um


<PAUSE:17>
S9: see why does it ask specifically? (do you) wanna know about the end of (xx) s- end of the lives well, we're gonna also have a supernova and (xx) like it's gonna (xx) [S6: so i put, just i don't ] like you know it's gonna be a supernova and in the center you're gonna either have a neutron star or a black hole, it's kinda hard to say, definitively, this is going to be a neutron star.


S6: so should i just say supernova (xx)


S9: like you wanna say supernova but you also wanna say say what's left in the core which'll be, a black hole or a neutron star. [S6: so i wanna say ] you wanna mention them both. for both of those (xx)


<PAUSE:07>
S6: alright, could that be [S5: hm? ] what's (xx) (xx) is that a sun?


S9: it's not, it's referring to a different one but yeah, it's the sun do you remember what happens to the sun?


S6: in all those years, it's gonna turn into, what is it gonna turn into? a black hole?


S9: it's not massive enough it needs to have at least three solar masses


S6: oh cuz it's only one [S5: mhm ] so, it'll be a neutron or a white dwarf. it's a white dwarf right?


S9: mhm, because, a white dwarf is, anything that's up to one-point-four-four solar masses. so, like if it has more than that, you get a supernova [S6: okay ] and you end up with a neutron star.


S6: okay so since it's one to begin with it's not gonna be more than that right?


S9: mhm, but you're also gonna hafta blo- like it's gonna be a supergiant, before it becomes a white dwarf and all that stuff from i- from the supergiant is (xx)


S6: (right there?)


S9: yeah, but [S6: (xx) the gases? ] what (xx) what what does it what does it, leave behind?


S6: like what gas is it?


S9: yeah well, you know what? what does the gas look like? what is that called? [S6: (xx) ] um, it's actually, a uh, planetary (nebula) [S6: (xx) ] yeah like, like, it just kinda like the mass just kind of floats away (xx) it doesn't have a big explosion because it never starts (xx) it just kinda gets cold and dark. but that kinda blows off cuz there's solar wind and all that stuff and so, you end up with (planetary) nebula, just blows around like that (xx) you know what it's cuz they all (xx)


S6: okay...


S9: i know it's (xx)

S6: so it's like this is a cool star?


S9: yeah it's a cool star and you know it's not gonna be real massive


S6: so it'll probably be a white dwarf as well?


S9: most likely


S6: (you're) just guessing (xx) and then um, (xx) the last one, collision is between two dwarfs


S9: well, you know, there are the mass limit of white dwarf, is one-point-four solar masses, combined with one-point, the one-point-eight so you know that it, um


S6: so that's a, (supernova?)


S9: yeah you're gonna have, see you're gonna like it's gonna, it goes supernova (xx) so you know you're gonna have (xx) it's gonna have (xx) more than one-point-four


S6: (xx) since this is one-point-eight and it's, gonna be less than three, [S9: yeah ] more than one-point-four?


S9: yeah


S6: so this is gonna be uh


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S6: um, i think you have (my) mass, cuz it says (xx) and then i get the G, from the book and i got this from the book and i just plug them in and i, [S9: mhm ] so um, i would just do that with everything? [S9: yeah ] and then for the mass of the sun, or the earth (and the) (xx) where do i get all these from? like the book


S9: those are in the book <PAUSE:04> i can actually, give you the one for the sun i don't (remember) (xx) but i [S6: okay ] but i, yeah but just put those in


S6: okay so that one i can (xx) but what is this one?


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S9: it's asking about the universe like if it was all a black hole so you know you have... you know, you'll you'll find the radius (xx) you just want the radius, the radius of the (sun) you assume it's (xx) and so then you have to find the volume, cuz density is mass per unit volume, so [S6: okay ] and you know the mass, cuz it gives you the mass, and then you have the volume (xx)


S6: okay, cuz this is, cubed right? [S9: what? ] length cubed is, volume?


S9: um, four-thirds-pi-R, cu- cubed


S6: okay, oh that's just for a square would be length? (xx) (or something) [S9: yeah ] a cube?


S9: for a cube yeah [S6: cube, right. ] but if you wan- it's probably (xx) easier cuz, things get (xx)


S6: so four-thirds-pi, four-thirds-pi-R-cubed right? or is that wrong? (xx) so that's all i do (xx)


S9: yeah, well that's, well that's all you, you know you have mass over volume [S6: right ] (xx) distance


S6: and so that's all i can say for that. and i [S5: (xx) ] okay good thank you


S9: cool


<CONVERSATION IIC: 64:05 - 101:32>
S1: oh my gosh i took this pad again. every time i go to_ every single week that i go to physics tutoring i leave with a pad of paper. okay so uh, starting with?


S11: um, i don't really (xx) [S1: okay <LAUGH>] um, i just kinda wanna go write my own (xx)


SU-f: okay


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S1: what does, the fact that the planets all orbit a uh what book are you using?


S11: uh, fourth edition


S1: uh, Universe?


S11: so y- y- you're the one who (xx)


S1: aha [SU-m: (xx) ] (xx) okay cool. [SU-m: (xx) ] alright, free CD-Rom. is it cool?


S11: i, used it once but no, not really.


S1: okay.


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S11: (xx) the right chapters (i don't know) it might be in chapter nine


S1: so the first one says uh what does the size of the planets (xx) what's the sun (xx) tell us about the age of our solar nebula? so, um, let's go to a chapter where it talks about the formation of the solar system.


S11: alright i can do that... cuz usually his questions don't really just, pertain to one chapter (you know what i mean) [SU-f: mhm ] they're (like) all over the place, (xx)


S1: i don't know if there is a, chapter where it's, talks about, f- f- formation of the solar system (that you can see.)


S11: it mentioned the stars (xx)


S1: okay (xx) stars our sun, sun our star, that might be useful, um, (building) the solar system, you know it's, like way of ahead of probab- probably where you are


S11: yeah probably right [S1: but, it ] cuz we're right in this area [S1: probably (but we could) look there ] (alright, we can do that)


<PAUSE WHILE READING>
S1: looking ahead?


S11: yeah (something like that,) <S1: LAUGH> see what else is out there.


S1: okay so, (xx) it's obviously some (xx) so a nebular hypothesis, our model theory (where is it?) uh, (xx) um you can combine (vortex and,) rotating cloud (matter) own gravitational, own gravitational (xx) as the disc (xx) consider_ okay, so um rotating cloud matter. <PAUSE WHILE READING> so um, m- the question was what does the fact that all planets, all the planets, the planets all over (xx) of the solar nebula. so i guess, (making the sun?)


S11: um, that it all formed from one main, solar nebula.


S1: right, and uh, it said here that, the, the model of the rotating cloud of matter contracting, with, under (xx) rotation, and flattening into a disc that's the disc, the flattened disc [S11: mhm ] at, which time, i guess, yeah, became, the planets. [S11: okay, so, ] it's the (xx) [S11: alright ] <MUMBLING WHILE READING> so that's um... is this the, okay so that's the (xx) the nebula solar hypothesis solar, okay here we go, um planets were formed from the, disc (xx) sun as uh, stars formed (xx) okay so, the rotation of the cloud caused the dust, and gas to s- form a spinning disc [S11: oh okay ] so as it spun then it came out into a disc [S11: oh okay (xx) ] so it was the rotation, um <PAUSE WHILE READING> oh, this is ridiculous (xx) okay so now (extrasolar planets,) we don't care about that. so now the next one tells us, what is the possible, explanation for the very unusual orbits of Venus and, Uranus, and, Pluto


S11: probably would be, (xx) orbits? [S1: yeah ] they were probably struck by, some other foreign object [S1: maybe ] possibly a comet or, a meteorite


S1: um, actually, [S11: (xx) ] (let's check) there, they were actually proposed like this extra planet, planet X [S11: oh that's right yeah ] yeah, i remember that too like maybe, (xx)


S11: (xx) you can describe it any way, basically it's like


S1: right so, i don't know how uh... okay wait here we go, um, which planets did they say? Venus, Uranus so it looks like this, is a P, the solar nebula hypothesis is evolutionary um, gradually build the planets (xx) this looks, very important. [S11: very important right there ] you should read that, mhm [S11: okay ] that's strange that he makes you read ahead so far (xx) [S11: mm ] <LAUGH>


<PAUSE WHILE READING>
S1: yeah


S11: (xx)


S1: that's what he said


S11: <PAUSE WHILE READING> this looks pretty good... (alright) <PAUSE WHILE READING> he doesn't exactly follow the book, that's one of the problems [S1: yeah ] does his own thing i guess


<PAUSE WHILE READING>
S1: what is this say why do Jovian planets have more moons than terrestrial planets


S11: probably be- because, they have a larger area, of gravitational pull (xx) [SU-f: mkay ] (xx...) it's funny how it fits in right in the chapter


S1: i know it looks [S11: it's crazy ] strange. uh, helio formation, <MUMBLING WHILE READING> (xx) could not do this because it, never became massive enough okay so uh... (xx) asteroids (xx) okay, that's the (xx) uh, proton (xx) into the sun, asteroids, satellite systems, of the Jovians may continue to (xx) <PAUSE:06> uh, it doesn't look like, anything in there, [S11: (xx) ] maybe (xx) turn the page (xx) <PAUSE:08> maybe it's just i mean, cuz they're so massive they just started


S11: well it mention them right here although, um [SU-f: mhm ] i don't know (xx)


S1: okay <PAUSE:06> so you see anything here that could, answer that question?


S11: not exactly. [S1: okay ] (not with) the information i already know


S1: okay, so let's see here, i don't know how, planet earth, they probably go through all the planets


S11: yeah, yeah i think they (do) i think they do


S1: this is really strange you have to, is this like a review for?


S11: this is the last assignment before the midterm (xx) [S1: okay ] so


S1: it's just very strange that (xx)


S11: so this one will have to be even more abstract than, some of the others.


S1: mkay, that's weird <PAUSE WHILE READING> (here)


S11: all this (xx) Jupiter came from the Roman gods, you know give me credit.


S1: <LAUGH> i know <LAUGH> um, that's really strange i think that, (xx) directly from the, <LAUGH> (xx) [S11: wow ] <PAUSE WHILE READING> history of the Galileo years <PAUSE WHILE READING> i think, if uh, right so if you could uh, so the J- Jovian planets are a lot larger so they're almost like a sun [S11: oh ] so they probably have, their own accretion discs, [S11: mm ] actually, they're only, what page is that? four-oh-six?


S11: something like that, we started down that list.


S1: yeah, i think actually it says in here somewhere, right? (xx) oh yeah, (just,) where did i read that i just read that. um, solar hypothesis, um, oh where did we see the first, solar hypothesis?


S11: probably in chapter nine


S1: here i'll help you find out.


S11: (i don't know) alright. <PAUSE WHILE READING> (xx) right here, on (xx)


S1: (xx) to, the velocity, solar (xx) it says


S11: (xx) think it was page uh, four-oh-three.


S1: (xx) let's see if it's still back there, passing (stuff,) earlier, oh here we go... (xx) the disk (xx) oh this is the stuff that, was uh <PAUSE WHILE READING> i think yeah, i think it's just that, they were so massive that they had their own, discs around them that actually form (xx) [S11: okay ] cuz that's i mean


S11: if, that might, (xx) yeah [SU-f: okay ]


<PAUSE:06>
S1: yeah, this is (xx)


<PAUSE WHILE READING>
S1: so it's like, something you're gonna have to look up.


S11: yeah, um <PAUSE WHILE READING> so, (xx)


S1: let's start, in the index [S11: yeah ] um, (mass) density, four-eighteen.


S11: he must be using the (xx) the chapter kinda thing you know it?


S1: yeah that's kinda strange, has he assigned readings?


S11: yeah he assigns readings on the first, twelve chapters (xx) it's right here


S1: chapter twenty-eight?


S11: (i don't know,) but i don't know how to study from (now on,) just go on to the higher chapters (xx)


S1: yeah just, you just need to look in the uh, index for the word, key words and, <S11: ADDRESSES S1> what?


S3: nothing don't don't pay attention.


S7: i'll talk to you later (xx) um


S3: um, coded messages


S1: more, more talking about me, like when i'm (like) still in the room? (yeah)


S7: (xx)


S3: you know (xx)


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S11: i would imagine that's probably alright there


S1: yeah i think i think that most of it's in the book [S11: yeah... yeah ] like this one is gonna involve some (computations) i don't know, who


S11: (xx)


S1: so that i mean i don't know, [SU-m: yeah ] i mean check that out see (xx)


S11: okay.


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S1: do you have questions, about those geosynchronous orbits?


S11: well yeah it was it's probably (right here) anyway and and they give you the kind of questions (xx) questions (xx) distance of a quasar (xx) or something


S1: i mean all, that you have to do, is know um (xx) so you wanna, you wanna make sure that your, period, equals um twenty-four hours right? cuz, w- you know you're going the at same rate (as this one) and uh period equals uh what is it like two-pi-V over R? [S11: okay ] or something like that, [S11: alright ] i think and so you can find, um, let's see wait is that right? two-pi-V over R? and then, do you know that that's that so, you could probably plug that into here and solve.


S11: okay i can do that (xx) <PAUSE:06> well if it's not i can use notes (from class.) i still have my notes (from class)


S1: yeah it's probably i mean, (most of the) stuff seems to be, in the book


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S11: (xx)


S1: okay, okay so you (xx) by satellite, two-way mirror, watch (xx) pairs so alright so you've got, um, so you've gotta do like resolutions here, [S11: mhm ] um, you've got, two millimeter mirror, or two meter mirror [S11: yeah ] and you've got, wanna be able to resolve some saying, something that's like, half a meter, or something like [S11: okay ] yeah say, say [S11: alright ] like half a meter. [S11: yeah ] so, y- you wanna be able to resolve, (it's like what's it,) it's like five meters, and you've got a two meter mirror, (xx) disorganized, so um... so how far above the earth, does the sunlight need to be? so now, you're gonna do, something like this, um, let's see, what are we gonna do? we are going to, let's see, (xx)


S11: it'd probably be in the light chapter


S1: okay, light and color scope excuse me. <READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE> (xx) we don't care about that yet <PAUSE:07> (xx) wait wait wait, what's this all about? (xx) <PAUSE:17> absorbing power in seconds of arc equals (xx) (not really what we're trying to do) you've got, you've got (xx) triangle, so you've got, some distance D [S11: mhm ] and you've got, some, other distance here R... this is your angle theta [S11: oh (xx) ] but it's not really like that cuz it's more like, (then again) it is kinda like that. cuz, uh it's like, weird it's like cuz this is bigger, and that's gonna be a lot smaller so it's something weird like this but, um [S11: oh okay ] so, let's keep looking <PAUSE WHILE READING> okay, how about notes? has he given you any notes on uh resolution?


S11: uh, okay (uh let me check?)


S1: <PAUSE WHILE READING> okay (so) <PAUSE WHILE READING> (what does that mean resolve (xx) <PAUSE WHILE READING>


S11: (xx) exactly (xx) flip through (this so) i can remember


S1: <PAUSE WHILE READING> then you've got oh okay... okay, this is what you're_ i think you're gonna do. you're gonna use this resolving power, thing here see it says the resolving power alpha in seconds of arc is equal to eleven-point-six divided by the diam- diameter [S11: okay ] so, you're, given the diameter so you can plug this is this is in terms of centimeters. [S11: okay (xx) ] so, do that <PAUSE:21> i'm not sure yeah, so, this is not an important triangle <LAUGH>[S11: okay ] that's okay


S11: i'm usually (passed out at this point)


<PAUSE:06>
S1: so you're gonna find alpha in terms of arc seconds, okay? [S11: okay ] and that's gonna be this angle here, theta... [S11: mhm ] and um, then your R here, is gonna equal to be zero-point-five meters... and this is, the distance that you wanna calculate? okay? [S11: mhm ] so this is like um, this is the satellite, (xx) it's got little, things coming out of it [S11: (xx) ] and this is on the earth. so, you want D as the distance okay? [S11: okay ] and the way to solve for that, basically so you've got um, you can pretend this is a right triangle, opposite over hypotenuse so it's like, so i don't know if you remember your trig, so, opposite over hypotenuse so that's R over D, is equal to sine, theta, but theta's really small [S11: right ] so that's approximately equal to just theta? [S11: okay ] so in other words, D, equals uh, R over theta, does that make sense? the way i did that?


S11: kind of refreshing (me) yeah


<PAUSE:15>
S1: and this is how you're gonna find D. [S11: okay ] keeping this uh you can keep this still in meters, but make sure this is uh i think this is (xx) seconds [S11: okay ] so like, if uh, let's see what we can get, one of them divided by two, hundred, centimeters, um, oh wait we said that, this is equal to theta. like, so (xx) that, so we'll say uh, divide it by (xx) that... i think actually no, i think this has to be in degrees, theta has to be in degrees... radians, no no no, wait, sine (xx)


S11: (doesn't it) have to be in agreement?


S9: hm?


S11: do they have to be in radians (xx)


S1: i think it has to be in_ actually, it's more like a formula, you know um, R equals D, theta, radians?


S9: R equals D theta_ um actually it's


S11: degrees


S9: yeah i think it's radians, that's what makes, i think it's, radians


S1: is it or?


S9: uh no it's uh s- it depends on w- on how you set up you have <WRITING> diameter... equals angle, in arc seconds, times, the distance, to object, uh divided by two-oh-six-two-six-five


S1: that's when it's in arc seconds


S3: i think what you're thinking


S9: that's in arc seconds


S3: i think y- i think what you're think-


S1: right so, if you put it into radians than you're [SU-f: then yeah ]


S3: i think what you're thinking is for, D-S the the length of that part is is R E theta or just theta R theta


S1: yeah so if if you convert this into radians or can use this formula here where um, we say that R is equal to, um, theta, in w- arc seconds, times D divided by two-oh-six-two-six-five, which is the number of, arc seconds in a, in d- in a degree or in three hundred sixty degrees?


S3: what's that?


S1: two-oh-six-two-six-five that's the number of, arc seconds [SU-f: three hundred sixty ] in three hundred sex- sixty degrees, let me make sure that's right though


S9: um, i just looked it up


S1: you just looked it up and it was right?


S9: yeah <LAUGH>


S1: okay


S9: i actually spent a a you know a good fifteen minutes on that formula so <LAUGH>


S1: okay, alright (xx) multiply the (xx) by say D, well we_ this is what we're looking for is D [S11: okay ] so um divide this by two-oh-six-two-six-five, yeah, this looks um, does this look right? um, i don't know if this is right. <PAUSE:10> okay, one divided by this... you multiply that by point-five, yeah you're gonna get like, a lot of meters then, like three (ten to the) sixty meters probably um, so, this, is important information, that should be like, small angle formula (xx) in the book <PAUSE WHILE READING>


S11: (xx) actually have it


S1: i don't know. four eighty-two. yes, see? the angle diameter [S11: mhm ] over two-si- two-oh-six-two-six-five arc seconds this is (xx) in uh, (xx) is equal to the linear diameter in other words, the diameter of the football player [S11: okay ] (would be) the distance away. does that make sense?


S11: i think it does yeah


S1: okay so there's the formula that you're using [SU-m: yeah ] here okay...? <ANSWERS QUESTION FROM OTHER CONVERSATION> that's really quite random. there's that, so that's_ this is, now it says calculate the orbital speed, of the geosynchronous, (xx) that chapter?


S11: (i don't know, somewhere)


S1: somewhere up there. yeah, ah perfect. alright so, then um, what would the orbital period, be? do you have any idea how you might go around uh, go about, doing that?


S11: orbital period? [SU-f: mhm ] um, probably not


S1: okay let's see (xx) so you know, that um <PAUSE WHILE READING> well, okay they wanna watch the (xx) which i think is (xx) [SU-m: okay ] so, what kind of orbit would that be?


S11: (amount of) time? [SU-f: yeah ] like distance, that would probably be like three hours


S1: just to w- well, but i mean it wants to stay in the same place, so what kind of an orbit is that?


S11: oh um, so what kind of orbit the one (the) satellite's in


S1: let's see here. let's go back to this geosynchronous stuff. [S11: yeah ] um where was that?


S11: geosynchronous? uh, page four-eighteen


S1: four-eighteen? really? [S11: i think so ] <PAUSE WHILE READING>[S11: i think it was ] i think it's earlier than that (radial) telescopes


S11: what question was it?


S1: number i- it's uh, it was number, three


S11: three?


S1: yeah i just didn't know which one


S11: number three, i don't have (xx)


S1: you don't have (xx) <READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE> that's okay we'll find it, light and telescopes, what's this one about? yeah this is it <PAUSE:07> so, what did we say again um, well we don't really know if it's a geosynchronous orbit cuz_ although it is staying (about) the same, point, but um, we can find, let's find the period. let's find a, equation for period [S11: okay ] before we, make any generalizations that may or may not be right. period they don't have a period. orbital <MUMBLING WHILE READING> so you know the distance, and you wanna find the period <PAUSE:05> does that look like something you might (xx) does that look like, a bunch of uh... those equations, might be um, important?


S11: um we haven't used this, this equation but we've used these first two


S1: okay this one is just um, if you plug, this one into here, if you set these two equal? [S11: okay ] then square it? right because square root of the square root so then you've got the four-pi-squared, R-squared times this R then you bring out_ do you want me to show you


S11: yeah i (know how to do that) yeah okay


S1: so you got_ i'm just gonna skip the squaring part and just gonna skip the squaring part and (xx) four-pi, uh, R-squared over, P-squared right? bring that R over so now you just (rewrite) this so P is brought over here. this equals, four-pi-R-squared, now times another R, divided by (xx) which is that [S11: (xx) ] okay so, there (xx) you get, M is the terminal mass of the system (xx) the gas where a planet orbiting the sun (leaves) the mass of the sun so, in other words, for this one you're gonna use the mass of, the earth. [S11: okay ] um, and you know the distance right cuz we fig- we would have figured it out (xx) and then using this, you know the masses, map- mass of the earth is like, something times ten-to-the-four, or ten-to-the-twenty-four, it might even be, uh there's probably constants somewhere in here


S11: yeah, oh yeah, it's in_ it's right on the back cover (xx) right there, (xx)


S1: (xx) that's awful (xx)


S11: probably like (xx)


S1: mass of the earth, is like, six times ten to the twenty-fourth so just plug that in there you know G [S11: mhm ] okay? [S11: okay ] does that make sense? [S11: actually that's ] (important equation) in there, that should work [S11: alright ] and <PAUSE:14> um, so then, you'll find the orbital period and this is how much (xx) watch with one satellite, [S11: and then so, this value then? ] then you (just) have to find out you know, whether or not it's moving faster, than twenty-f- i mean is it gonna be (xx) certain point, like cuz a ge--in a (xx)


S8: (xx)


S1: (xx) what?


S11: i was just, (xx)


S1: oh, it might have been a [SU-m: oh oh oh <LAUGH>] (xx) i mean if it was if, like, cuz you know in a geosynchronous orbit (xx) always (xx) so if they were (xx) then they could see, the whole thing but [SU-f: (xx) ] right. but um, i think i- depending on what the distance is you can compare with a geosynchronous orbit you can say whether or not it's longer, or um, less, [S11: is it, is ] and um you can, so once you find up here (you know then) you can find (xx) see how long it takes to go around the earth and you know what the earth's rotation is, so you can make some sort of estimate (or something) (xx)


S11: (xx) (like tested) on...? cuz he wrote down some, pretty funky stuff too. and i was like oh my god i was like


S9: um thermo [S11: oh, okay ] we do a lot of probability stuff in thermo.


S11: okay. (that's scary)


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S1: um, i don't know if, terminal velocity may come in or not


S11: no [S1: okay ] because it says ignore air resistance [S1: okay ] so basically it'd just be then (xx) whatever [S1: okay ] (xx)


<UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH>
S11: that's probably (xx)


S1: okay. is that good?


S11: it's yeah, it's, (xx) [S1: okay ] (xx) really longer


S1: i hope i helped.


S11: oh, definitely.


S1: okay good. <LAUGH>


S11: (xx)


<CONVERSATION IID: 64:06-78:59>
S5: (Chris) made me go in front


S12: oh again?


S5: <LAUGH> yeah she was like you're okay i was like, oh


S12: how did she make you? [S5: i was like ] well you remembered. [S5: i know, but i was (like) ] i remembered it too but i was in the (back) (xx)


S5: cuz i was like [S12: i was shy ] i gotta be somebody else has to know this too, and i was like dude, i was like, i was just marking up there, and she was like alright, now you go u- (i was like)


S12: yeah that girl was like, you know what sh- she knows (it)


S5: i know i was like no, sh sh <SS: LAUGH> and i was kinda getting annoyed cuz she couldn't remember it.


S12: who, the teacher? what's her name? [S5: yeah ] i don't even know her name?


S5: i don't think anybody knows her name. she never passed out a syllabu- syllabus, did she?


S12: no but, i have a question (um) aren't we supposed to go to some events? [S5: yeah ] just, go on our own?


S5: yeah, (xx) stuff, performances.


S12: (xx) any event (xx)


S5: yeah, pretty much. i think that like, some she prefers over others, cuz i heard people like talking to her and stuff.


S12: how do we know? oh you have to ask her?


S5: yeah <LAUGH> but, like, yeah i don't wanna be like hey, uh uh ye- uh


S12: um, Lisa and I are going, on Wednesday, i think to a performance (xx)


S5: yeah, yeah like i i had two other classes here, two other dance classes, and like usually it was like, two pages, you know just kinda like describing, what you noticed and, you know [S12: okay ] just like commenting on the choreography and the costumes things like that (xx)


S12: so this is (what) a jazz thing or can we go to like a tap thing, cuz i love tap.
