S1: right. here uh the clipboard. that i ga- okay there. um on the, clipboard is, what i came up with um, at three-thirty in the morning last night. uh, because, i was, sort of reading through the last chapter again where i was talking about, um, folk music and how to sort of nuance that view an- and see um, rap music and then, what i, realized then was that i want to um, explain s- sort of say, this is why they could have come under criticism this is why they were doing sort of uh making a cultural faux pas but then at the same time um, it's absolutely not surprising at all they were accepted by the, um, rap canon thing they moved on because they had not only um, talent and flow, but also um, that, um not all rap is political or has to be community-building or has to to, has to mean anything [S2: Speaker information restricted] and the um, and even when it does, the importance of political rap becomes the message not the messenger. which is to say that if, they had been black had chosen to, um, as Chuck D puts it you know be black America's C-N-N, that um it wouldn't matter whether or not they were middle class it wouldn't matter whether or not they were um, you know they'd gone to private school what would, basically matter is uh, what was being said and and how they were saying it. um, so, i wanna split it up and, in the first part um, talk about how, sort of say, what i just said which is to say that um that, uh, rap is equally valued in i- its flow its abil- its ability to introduce uh, familiar, sounds in new and interesting ways and, how it sounds as much as it is for its, community-building, use as social protest sort of uh, yo- keeping i- the a a pulse on on black America and then, um, and then, sort of say, you know rappers are not stuck being cultural emissaries or spokespeople for the black community, rather it can be about, all the other things so then, um, what i wanna do is, follow with an analysis of the song Sure Shot, [S2: Speaker information restricted] and through, Tricia Rose's definition of flowin' and looking elsewhere in terms of what makes rap um, what makes it good on a purely sonic level explain how this song, um in specific demonstrates all these things. and how, it you know when it when it comes down to, it it's sort of like um, Wynton Marsalis who's always saying you know you can argue with me for years about the what the music means but, but then critics will sort of slam him and he'll say well let's play. let's leave it up to the music to decide. and then um, so, taking that, methodology, um, taking analysis of Sure Shot and showing how, that is, useful as opposed to something that wasn't. um, and then after that, explain how um, that, had they chosen to be_ and and, take a deeper look at, black messengers. which is to say, the um, through a short biography of Chuck D and to um, and, looking at his lyrics say, um here is authentic, political black rap. and here is um, you know you know authentic being in quotes, and um, that even when it is, strictly culturally meaningful, that uh, it, um, that the the important part there is what, the text rather than the, speaker of the text. [S2: Speaker information restricted] does that seem, useful?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: three
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: right. th- chapter two sort of sets up, um, the, how rap sort of has fit into the heavily guarded, folk being in quo- cul- in quotes uh folk culture of, of previous black musics um but then, um, chapter three i wanna sorta spend, tearing some of that down or at least complicating it with, um, with the truth which is that the truth being that you know, it doesn't matter, your background you don't even necessarily need to, um be from the street to uh, to be, accepted and understood. that yes, skin color definitely does matter [S2: Speaker information restricted] because of, reasons cited before like from the first [S2: Speaker information restricted] chapter, uh on minstrel singing and uh, and white privilege but then, but when it comes to it down to it like a- acceptance has more to do with flow and it has more to do, um, and less to do with the uh, the k- social background of the, [S2: Speaker information restricted] of the rapper. does that make sense?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: so how do i measure, how do i measure that?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: so how do i, fix that? because i i feel as though, what i wanna, say is is talk about um, i mean certainly that there is a sort of, level of um, i mean they they still continue to sell records they still
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: c- uh, the Beastie Boys c- [S2: Speaker information restricted] continue to to be, successful, [S2: Speaker information restricted] there's um, they manage to uh, stay within the rap within, uh i i mean again i hate to use the word, word rap community but what i mean is that they um A Tribe Called Quest puts out, Midnight Marauders, [S2: Speaker information restricted] and the, cover of it uh the C-D has uh, you know, every rapper they know in headphones. you know everyone from, you know people in the Wu Tang to uh to, them and the Beasties are are there right there with them. right [S2: Speaker information restricted] next to everybody and i mean it's, it's kind of funny because you can pick you know they're the only white faces on the disc, but um, but they're there in the same way that uh that, that Q-Tip comes and and does a guest spot on, on their record and uh, you know they win the, ninety-eight Video Vanguard Award the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award and it's presen-
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: it was presented to them by Chuck D and Public Enemy. [S2: Speaker information restricted] and the rest of th- Public Enemy and you know and and Chuck D's f- publicly gets up and says you know they were with us from the beginning and, [S2: Speaker information restricted] all that now wheth- whether or not you know that he was reading a TelePrompTer, [S2: Speaker information restricted] or or not i i think is uh
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: so, i- but i i think that like nonetheless that there's something that i'm grasping at there which is to say that they have, stuck around longer than oth- any other white rappers. they have sold more records more than any other white rappers they have um made more, f- they have more friends who rap, and rap, they have more rapper friends and they have more producer friends and they they have more ties in the, rap recording [S2: Speaker information restricted] industry, than any other white rapper so, i understand that's, that sort of the the word acceptance is a is dangerous territory because not everyone has liked them and it's not as though they've been, um, that they are liked everywhere they go or that they, e- everybody even thinks they're talented but at the same time, there's something there that i'm that i'm, [S2: Speaker information restricted] struggling with not quite, getting
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: yeah oh i c- i completely understand what i what i'm, what i'm having difficulty with then, is to um
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: okay is somebody at the door?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S3: thanks. <S3: LEAVES>
S2: Speaker information restricted
<S4: ENTERS>
S4: i was wondering [S2: Speaker information restricted] if you could just sign this
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: yeah yeah
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: <LAUGH> if you wanna give money
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: yeah, i'm taking four other classes so, [S2: Speaker information restricted] i couldn't handle the workload
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: i need you to sign
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: yeah
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: no
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: unless it's me
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: 'm'm
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: i don't think you have to
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: yeah
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: thank you
<PAUSE:07>
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: i've read him believe me
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: <LAUGH> lots of him
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: well thank you for everything
S2: Speaker information restricted
S4: thank you. <LEAVES>
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: it's just i [S2: Speaker information restricted] i'm having trouble with the with this, uh to step out from the [S2: Speaker information restricted] from this chapter for a second in terms of, um, in terms of what i'm doing and in terms of what i'm writing and how i'm going [S2: Speaker information restricted] about it. i'm having a lot of trouble because i sort of feel as though, um, it it's frustrating because i have these ideas and then i- like i'll i'll for example with the last chapter like i
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: yes. um i, like read a lot for that and then, wrote a lot and whatever and and sort of uh you know, um, you know ate and slept and r- and and [S2: Speaker information restricted] breathed, that and then came back and then realized that like really, it was alright but that i needed a lot, [S2: Speaker information restricted] lot more and and sort of like with this one i'm i'm having the same trouble because [S2: Speaker information restricted] it's um, because i'm sort of feel like i can't, <SIGH>
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i i can't articulate what i'm trying to say i guess what i'm trying to, w- what i mean is that like, all of this, makes a great deal of sense to me but i always feel like, eh, almost as though what i'm trying to say, like i- is either a book, <LAUGH> or it's um, something which is so, incredibly more complicated that i couldn't get a thesis out of it. [S2: Speaker information restricted] do you see what i'm saying? like the trying to, s-
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i- it's, it's not a question of asking too much i- it's a question of um, i- it's, and people who write about music sort of continually have to cover every base. [S2: Speaker information restricted] you know and have to make sure that i- it's like uh, i- i- you know trying to, to protect a uh, house from the [S2: Speaker information restricted] um, from uh the pouring rain every, everywhere you're coming there's a new, hole sprouting up in your argument. [S2: Speaker information restricted] you know what i mean? [S2: Speaker information restricted] and and so, it's difficult for me because the the, what i was saying last week about um about folk music makes a great deal of sense to me and then you know everywhere i go it's like well there's a new there's this new hole uh of, um, of you know, rappers who are actually saying, so- socially or culturally meaningful things, don't necessarily_ it doesn't matter what their background is because look at, who you know the the real guys look look at them, you know, they happen to be black but they're just as rich and they are you know they they they come from the same affluence [S2: Speaker information restricted] and so it's like, well, okay let's deal with that. and so go
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: when i when i go back
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: okay. th- so
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: if i write this and then sort of, say a- a- and uh, i- i- um do you remember there's a paragraph in chapter two where i said you know i, st- sort of stepped back and said i race to to note here, that um, that when i'm talking about, you know black musics or when i'm talking about a, uh i- you know music of, or black or white America, i in no way mean to overgeneral- generalize or imply that you know all blacks are poor living in the [S2: Speaker information restricted] ghetto and blah blah blah there was a, part where i sort of said, what i mean to specify is, that there is a, um specific community, or a specif- specific group of people that um, that understands, this as a as a, code. and i i don't even know if i have the chapter around. but the point is is i think that that, um, the idea of, uh, a- any rap community having, contradictory, and multiple voices is is one, that i want to inclu- include and one that i wanna sort of that's another base i wanna cover or a a hole that i would like to plug with a with a few paragraphs [S2: Speaker information restricted] um, but at the same time, i, i mean if you look at a group like 3rd Base, you know who sort of did a a_ had a very similar, [S2: Speaker information restricted] a gig going you know three white rappers who were um, who were, you know from the same kind of background and trying to do the same thing and they just didn't have it. for whatever reason like they they were a party band as well i think, and they uh, they just, weren't that good. and i they didn't gain, an acceptance as measured by, support by other rappers um, album sales and, uh, you know support from, the media and M-T-V and and so forth, um that the Beasties did and by that that's what i mean by, acceptance which isn't to say that there is, one opinion which said yes you're okay but i think that, that, there is a uh, there is a a, something to be said for, for all of that as a a, an approval that uh, that others haven't gotten. [S2: Speaker information restricted] and it's an achievement. [S2: Speaker information restricted] does that make sense?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: what part doesn't?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: you don't see the the commercial part as as, being indicative of anything?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: yeah
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: are you kidding? uh well, okay.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i don't think she's the best singer i think that
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i i think that um, the, style in which she's doing her music and the, instrumentation and and the um, the, her hispanocentrism, i think is something which is unusual, and it [S2: Speaker information restricted] is something which is um, to be commended. and that's what i you know enjoy
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: got somebody at the door
<S2: LEAVES>
S2: Speaker information restricted
S5: yeah
S2: Speaker information restricted
S5: great
S2: Speaker information restricted
S5: should we anticipate a quiz on Thursday or?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S5: okay
S2: Speaker information restricted
S5: okay
S1: you would give two quizzes in the same week?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: oh okay i was gonna say <LAUGH>
<S5: LAUGH>
S2: Speaker information restricted
S5: okay thank you.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S5: see you Thursday <LEAVES>
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: yeah. i guess i sort of
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i think that the Beasties, what's, what surprises me about them is though, uh that everything they've done is so good. [S2: Speaker information restricted] i mean not, across the board, obviously but what i mean is that uh, that i think that there's a, um, that a lot of their, success and attention, has been pretty well deserved. i mean when they they
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: right but not, what i'm saying is not everyone gets the
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: no. what i'm saying is is that not everyone gets the, the Video Vanguard Award. [S2: Speaker information restricted] um you know the from, from M-T-V which is al- al- you know albeit a a uh, a
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: deeply compromised source of recognition sure but what i mean is is that uh, they do give airplay to people who are crap but at the same same time um they, you know the people who sort of, make it to the upper echelons of of their you know legendary status Madonna, uh, you know who are the people who've gotten the award? uh Madonna Michael Jackson Guns N' Roses, Tom Petty, uh, i forget a couple other people. um, but, you know these are all people who who have actually been putting out quality work that they_ it's it's not as though M-T-V wouldn't know quality if it hit 'em in the face, it's that um they amidst all this other, garbage that they're spewing out, you know twenty three hours a day, um there are people there who know what they're doing you know and and uh, [S2: Speaker information restricted] and, Kurt Loder, you know believe it or not is actually a pretty distinguished writer in in terms of some of his commentaries and and uh and, um, some of hi- his re- you know i i believe that he is aware of everything that's, you know e- exactly what kind of uh machines
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i disagree
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i think that he, um is using the news, uh M-T-V news to uh, for his own, for his own agenda and he is sort of the uh, he's sort of the last, guy kicking and screaming for for quality in the corner and he's [S2: Speaker information restricted] sort of pushing everyth- you know what i mean? like they uh
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i mean i- it's sort of like if you watch um, Total Request Live versus watching uh, something, any of his special reports or any of the Rockumentaries that he used to put [S2: Speaker information restricted] on or or anything. the, the amount of attention the amount of intellectual space that's being taken up, is vastly different. so i i sort of feel like there, [S2: Speaker information restricted] there is a you know, that to to say that s- um t- that, recognition by, mainstream sources, um you know getting, on the cover of Rolling Stone or Spin or or and whatever you know, would necessar- wouldn't necessarily be, a, a marker of quality at the same time, um, you can't get to the level that they've gotten to without, without uh, you know you can make it to the cover of Rolling Stone once. you can't make it to the cover of Rolling Stone more than once, and have three different Spin covered devoted to you on the same month, you know they did that, one, head on every, issue thing and um, you don't get that without, without having as they would say the skills to pay the bills. do you see what i'm saying?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: more than once?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: really? especially_ uh even in terms of of her, message and agenda in the music
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: just_ right but i think that the the
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: right but Shania Twain the, codes are inextricable from her music i think. i mean you listen to, th- to to her albums and it it's not, um it's not very deeply entrenched. you see what i'm saying? you don't have to dig, very deep to to, um, you know a- and s- and so when that's, in the lyrics you can't you can't just say that like well the music's completely different from her message because the two are, one in the same aren't they?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: Shania's Twain songs?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: <SIGH> what if? i'm not following.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: <LAUGH> you sound so much like Adorno sometimes. <S2: LAUGH> just in terms of of of, your cynicism about the pop machine. you know and and and not being related to quality and and i um, one of the things that that, i am, and i s- this is a, perhaps a discussion for another time but i sort of feel like, um, i want to, agree with that, for the most part but i also know that um, i spent, a lot of time sort of being um, a- cantankerous in in terms of not wanting to like anything that was pushed on me. [S2: Speaker information restricted] that i would see th- you know i- if it was top forty i was not interested. um, was not interested whatsoever. and uh
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: so, aside then from, recognition of peers and, how does one_ how do i, i i mean i wa-
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: um, okay.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: Dr Dre
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: right. right but i'm st- the [S2: Speaker information restricted] earlier Dr Dre anyway. and maybe, Puffy if you
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: although that's a whole other can of worms.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: alright. um
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: okay. and now what i'm also worried about is is that uh, is just, in all honesty i am um, this has sorta ha- been my priority all semester, [S2: Speaker information restricted] and i feel like i am um, devoting
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: t- well not too much but i- i- just, proportionally too much. [S2: Speaker information restricted] especially to to have a a draft of a of a third chapter, in the middle of October, for, y- you know for something th- that uh, that i have after October's over s- an additional six months, to have completed, [S2: Speaker information restricted] i- it to me i- it's like um, i'm i'm just, really on the
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: right. um
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: lemme finish this chapter, either for next Tuesday or the following. um, <LAUGH> was that on the wall? uh, for for next Tuesday or the following and then, [S2: Speaker information restricted] um, because i, i also then the fourth chapter i had slated as sort of a history of the Beastie Boys [S2: Speaker information restricted] and i'm not sure, ho- i i mean i suppose that i could tell a story there but i don't i'm not sure that i would have a point, or an argument. and so
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: which uh even there is a i mean what i so what i'd like to do is finish this chapter and then um, i mean i- i- if, if we spend all of, November and December, editing, rehashing whatever i s- i, almost like i- i- it um, and you know i could be entirely wrong about this or overly optimistic, but i sort of feel like then i would be, done with those few chapters by Christmas break [S2: Speaker information restricted] and i could, um, you know and and i don't know what i'm gonna be doing at all next semester. um
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: no no i mean here with this thesis [S2: Speaker information restricted] i mean i'm gonna be having other classes but it would would it mean that like, if i i mean i feel like i'm worf- working at this same pace, [S2: Speaker information restricted] that i do or anything near i'm gonna be_ have, edited re-edited hashed rehashed and and you know and have, a pretty damn good product by
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: well and then in January, i- does it mean that i get January through, i mean i- should i plan to have, January through um, April to, uh to have it done and you know maybe tweak slightly but not, work as hard? am i am i working on that or i- because i sort of_ that's something that you and i haven't talked about
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: and so, so i'm i'm <S2: LAUGH> also like i'm afraid, like if i'm like
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: if i'm gonna be working this hard, <LAUGH> every week [S2: Speaker information restricted] for the next six months then [S2: Speaker information restricted] i'm gonna, die.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: okay. so
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: can we shoot to have to sort of complete, everything and and then in December and then
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: okay
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: okay. because [S2: Speaker information restricted] i also know that i you know that uh, from having, turned in things to you before and and stuff like that i know that i could turn it in and after five times that you would still have, <S2: LAUGH> comments which would, completely either, you know [S2: Speaker information restricted] revitalize the whole thing or or things that that would um, you know what i mean? [S2: Speaker information restricted] that that it's uh
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: well <LAUGH> you you understand my concern then
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: a- and that f- the problem with the folk chapter i think is strictly one of nomenclature. that that [S2: Speaker information restricted] that's one where you know i i was talking about [S2: Speaker information restricted] functions and characteristics [S2: Speaker information restricted] and whether or not i call it folk you know
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: right and and just sort of say this is, you know call it what you want to, [S2: Speaker information restricted] and then um
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: right. i just
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i so i wanna sort of divest myself of that. um can i
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: just_ ach also uh, there was something else i was gonna tell you and i can't remember.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: no
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i uh i went and saw Martin Sexton and [S2: Speaker information restricted] i saw um, somebody else. i forget oh uh, (Vacobena) and [S2: Speaker information restricted] uh, (Anthony Demoni.)
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: yeah. so well somebody surprised me with tickets and we had front row. [S2: Speaker information restricted] so um, ah it was it was really bad because like they uh, we thought the show started at eight, [S2: Speaker information restricted] and, it started at_ or we thought it it started thought at eight thirty. and it was actually starting at eight, [S2: Speaker information restricted] and then um, [S2: Speaker information restricted] so we went to Pizza House for dinner beforehand, [S2: Speaker information restricted] and sort of got the food at seven thirty, looked at our tickets realized it was eight oh' clock and we'd just ordered this big pitcher of uh of Bell's and [S2: Speaker information restricted] well you know s- twelve dollar pitcher so
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i'm twenty-one now
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: so, we, had this
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: not at all. so uh, so we, we you know we had to eat in, the space of fifteen minutes to, then make it over to the to the theater and there was no way we were gonna leave without you know paying we paid for, twelve dollars worth, we were gonna, drink it all so the [S2: Speaker information restricted] first, so exac- well i mean come on we paid for it. so uh, so i was sleepy through the entire show and i was and it was just really bad and i sort of was you know they asked us to clap and i couldn't for the life of me <LAUGH> cl- clap on rhythm and that was a little embarrassing, but um, <S2: LAUGH> but the show was wonderful. had the [S2: Speaker information restricted] best guitar players i've ever seen, ever. just in terms of straight, [S2: Speaker information restricted] uh, technical ability. okay um, i'll be back in a week then.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: what the new one?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: is it good?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: really.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: is it?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: i've, i've been still been listening a lot to uh to, Macy Gray
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: you're enjoying it? [S2: Speaker information restricted] did you buy the disc or did you?
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: the uh_ you know her voice it's like a preview record of what it would be like if uh Lauryn Hill and Tom Waits had a baby. (if they)
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: yeah
<SS: LAUGH>
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: anyway
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: alright well i'll have more soon and uh, i'll leave it in your box if you wanna look
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: well it's uh i'm also just, i think that i i made a horrible decision, in terms of you know in terms [S2: Speaker information restricted] of time no no. in terms of four in- uh, four independent studies.
S2: Speaker information restricted
S1: because i am budgeting all my own time and sort of like i explained this to all my teachers. (xx) it's just like i need a a class where they say, write a one-page response paper to this thing, [S2: Speaker information restricted] once a week, so that i can, feel like i've got it [S2: Speaker information restricted] done rather than once a month like having to turn in twenty pages to, [S2: Speaker information restricted] (xx) you know it's like ugh. [S2: Speaker information restricted] i gotta call over to work [S2: Speaker information restricted] and tell 'em i'm gonna be there is it alright if use your [S2: Speaker information restricted] phone? okay...
